# SDD State Schema

This document defines the format of the `sdd-state.md` file. smart-sdd automatically creates and manages this file.

**File location**: `./specs/reverse-spec/sdd-state.md` relative to CWD (or under the BASE_PATH specified with `--from`)

## Feature Mapping

Mapping table between Feature ID, spec-kit Feature Name (directory name), and git branch. The `short-name` portion MUST be identical across smart-sdd Feature ID and spec-kit Name (e.g., `F001-auth` ↔ `001-auth`).

| Feature ID | spec-kit Name | spec-kit Path | Branch | Merged |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| F001 | 001-auth | specs/001-auth/ | 001-auth | ✅ |
| F002 | 002-product | specs/002-product/ | 002-product | |

## Initial State Generation

When smart-sdd runs for the first time (when sdd-state.md does not exist), the initial state is generated using the following procedure:

1. Read `BASE_PATH/roadmap.md` to extract the Feature list and Tiers
2. Initialize all steps of all Features to `pending` (blank)
3. Leave the Feature Mapping table empty; map the spec-kit Name and Branch when each Feature's specify step is completed (spec-kit creates the branch during specify)
4. Initialize Constitution to `pending`
5. Set Origin based on how artifacts were generated:
   - `greenfield` — if initialized by `/smart-sdd init`
   - `reverse-spec` — if initialized from `/reverse-spec` artifacts
   - Origin does not change when Features are added later via `/smart-sdd add`
6. Set Source Path based on the project mode:
   - `greenfield` → `N/A` (no existing source code)
   - `reverse-spec` → Extract from the `**Source**:` field in `BASE_PATH/roadmap.md` (the original target-directory path used during `/reverse-spec`)
   - `add` (incremental) → `.` (source is the current working directory)
7. Set Scope:
   - `reverse-spec` → Read from `**Strategy**: Scope: [core|full]` in `BASE_PATH/roadmap.md`
   - `greenfield` (init) → Always `full`
   - If roadmap.md has no Scope info (legacy projects) → Default to `full`
8. Set Active Tiers based on Scope:
   - `core` → `T1` (only Tier 1 Features are initially active)
   - `full` → omit the `Active Tiers` field entirely (all Features are active, no Tier concept)
9. Set initial Feature Status:
   - `core` → Features whose Tier is in Active Tiers → `pending` (blank), others → `deferred`
   - `full` → all Features → `pending` (no deferred Features, no Tier column in progress table)

## State Update Rules

### When a Step Starts
- Change the corresponding cell to 🔄
- Record the start time in the Feature Detail Log
- Change the Feature Progress Status to `in_progress`

### When a Step Completes
- Change the corresponding cell to ✅ MM-DD
- Record the completion time and notes in the Feature Detail Log
- Update `Last Updated`

### When a Step Fails
- Change the corresponding cell to ❌
- Record the failure reason in the Feature Detail Log
- Feature Progress Status remains `in_progress` (retry is possible)

### When a Feature Completes (all steps including merge ✅)
- Change the Feature Progress Status to `completed`
- Mark the Feature as `✅` in the Merged column of the Feature Mapping table
- Add update history to the Global Evolution Log

### When a Step is Skipped (e.g., clarify not needed)
- Change the corresponding cell to ⏭️
- Record the skip reason in the Feature Detail Log

### When Scope is Expanded (via /smart-sdd expand — core scope only)
- Update the `Active Tiers` field to the new value (e.g., `T1` → `T1,T2`)
- Change `deferred` Features whose Tier matches the newly activated Tiers to `pending`
- Record the expansion in Global Evolution Log: "Scope expanded: T1 → T1,T2"
- Note: This rule only applies to `core` scope projects. `full` scope has no deferred Features.

### When a Feature is Restructured (via /smart-sdd restructure)
- Change affected step cells to 🔀 (all steps from the first affected step onward)
- Change Feature Progress Status to `restructured`
- Record the restructure operation in the Restructure Log
- If the Feature is **deleted**: remove the row from Feature Progress table entirely
- If a **new Feature** is created (e.g., split): add a new row with all steps blank (`pending`)
- If a Feature is **merged** into another: remove the absorbed Feature's row; update the surviving Feature's row
- Update `Last Updated`

### When a Restructured Feature Resumes
- When a 🔀 step starts execution, follow normal "When a Step Starts" rules (🔀 → 🔄)
- The 🔀 is replaced by 🔄, then ✅ upon completion
- When all 🔀 steps are re-executed successfully, change Status from `restructured` to `in_progress` or `completed` as appropriate

## Verification Result Recording

When the verify step is completed, record the following information in the Notes column of the Feature Detail Log:

```
Tests: [passed count]/[total count] passed
Build: [success/failure]
Lint: [success/failure/not configured]
Cross-Feature: [verification point count] checked, [issue count] issues
```
