# SDD State Schema

This document defines the format of the `sdd-state.md` file. smart-sdd automatically creates and manages this file.

**File location**: `./specs/_global/sdd-state.md` relative to CWD (or under the BASE_PATH specified with `--from`)

---

### State Validation (run at pipeline start)

Before reading sdd-state.md, validate:
1. File exists and is valid markdown
2. **State Schema Version** field present (missing = v1.0 legacy)
3. Required header fields present: Project, Origin, Domain Profile
4. Feature Progress table has correct column count (10 columns for full scope, 11 for core scope with Tier column)
5. All Feature IDs in progress table match Feature Mapping table
6. No duplicate Feature IDs

If validation fails:
- Display specific errors
- **Use AskUserQuestion**: "State file has issues: {error}. How to proceed?"
  - Options: "Auto-repair", "Manual fix", "Abort"
- **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

## Rebuild Configuration (rebuild only)

> Only present when Origin is `rebuild`. Omit this section for greenfield/adoption.
> Set during reverse-spec Phase 0 (from `roadmap.md` Strategy line). Read by pipeline steps per `domains/scenarios/rebuild.md`.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| change_scope | [stack / platform / framework / language / architecture / vendor] |
| preservation_level | [exact / equivalent / functional] |
| source_available | [running / code-only / docs-only] |
| migration_strategy | [big-bang / incremental / strangler-fig] |

If this section is missing in a legacy sdd-state.md (created before this enhancement), the pipeline initialization step presents AskUserQuestion to collect missing values.

## Environment Bootstrap (adoption only)

> Only present when Origin is `adoption`. Omit this section for greenfield/rebuild.

| Item | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Dependencies | [✅ installed / ❌ failed / ⏭️ skipped] | [package manager] |
| Environment  | [✅ configured / ⚠️ missing / ⏭️ skipped] | [.env details] |
| Build        | [✅ success / ❌ failed / ⏭️ skipped] | [build command] |
| Tests        | [✅ N/N passed / ⚠️ M/N passed / ⏭️ skipped] | [F] failed, [S] skipped |
| Run          | [✅ responds / ❌ failed / ⏭️ skipped] | [run command] |

If the user skips Environment Bootstrap, record a single row:

| Item | Status | Details |

## Constitution

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Status | [pending / completed] |
| Version | [MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH] |
| Completed At | [ISO 8601 date/time] |
| Updates | [Number of incremental updates] |

---

## Toolchain

> Detected by Foundation Gate Toolchain Pre-flight. verify Phase 1 reads this to skip unavailable tools.

| Tool | Command | Status | Detected At |
|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Build | npm run build | ✅ available | 2024-01-15T10:00:00 |
| Test | npm test | ✅ available | 2024-01-15T10:00:00 |
| Lint | npx eslint . | ⚠️ not installed | 2024-01-15T10:00:00 |

**Status values**:
- `✅ available` : Tool detected and executable
- `⚠️ not installed` : Config found but tool binary missing or not executable
- `ℹ️ not configured` : No configuration found for this tool type

**Update rules**:
- **Written by**: Foundation Gate Toolchain Pre-flight (first Feature or Foundation re-run)
- **Updated by**: verify Phase 1 Step 3b (retroactive — if user installed the tool between Features)
- **Re-detection trigger**: Foundation Gate re-runs when Foundation-affecting files change (e.g., `package.json` change qualifies)

---

## Foundation Verified

> Written by Foundation Gate (pipeline.md Step 3b). Read by pipeline to determine if Foundation Gate can be skipped for subsequent Features.

```
Foundation Verified: [ISO date] | [PASS/WARN/FAIL] | [details summary]
```

**Example**: `Foundation Verified: 2024-01-15T10:30:00 | WARN | Build ✅, Toolchain ⚠️ (lint not installed), CSS Theme ✅, Layout ✅`

**Skip logic**: If this field exists AND no Foundation-affecting changes since the recorded date → skip Foundation Gate. Foundation-affecting changes = modifications to files outside `specs/` (theme config, store definitions, layout components, IPC handlers, build config, package.json).

---

## Feature Progress

**Full scope** (no Tier column):

| Feature ID | Feature Name | specify | plan | tasks | analyze | implement | verify | merge | Status |
|------------|-------------|---------|------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| F001 | auth | ✅ 01-15 | ✅ 01-16 | ✅ 01-16 | ✅ 01-16 | ✅ 01-17 | ✅ 01-17 | ✅ 01-17 | completed |
| F002 | product | ✅ 01-18 | 🔄 | | | | | | in_progress |

**Core scope** (with Tier column):

| Feature ID | Feature Name | Tier | specify | plan | tasks | analyze | implement | verify | merge | Status |
|------------|-------------|------|---------|------|-------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| F001 | auth | T1 | ✅ 01-15 | ✅ 01-16 | ✅ 01-16 | ✅ 01-16 | ✅ 01-17 | ✅ 01-17 | ✅ 01-17 | completed |
| F002 | product | T1 | ✅ 01-18 | 🔄 | | | | | | in_progress |

### Step Status Icons
- ✅ : Completed (followed by completion date MM-DD)
- 🔄 : In progress
- ❌ : Failed
- ⚠️ : Limited (verify only — user acknowledged limited verification with a recorded reason; merge is allowed with reminder)
- ⏭️ : Skipped
- 🔒 : Deferred (outside current Active Tiers, activate via `/smart-sdd expand`)
- 🔀 : Needs re-execution (Feature affected by restructure or `/smart-sdd parity` — affected steps must be re-run; see `reference/restructure-guide.md`)
- (blank) : Not started

### Feature Status Values
- `pending` : Not yet started (all steps blank)
- `in_progress` : At least one step has started
- `completed` : All steps (including merge) are ✅ — code was built from SDD specs (greenfield/rebuild)
- `adopted` : All adopt steps (specify → plan → analyze → verify → merge) are ✅ — existing code wrapped with SDD docs (adoption only). Distinct from `completed`: signals legacy code that may have pre-existing issues
- `deferred` : Outside current Active Tiers (core scope only)
- `restructured` : Feature was modified (split/merge/move/delete) — has 🔀 steps that need re-execution (see `reference/restructure-guide.md`)
- `regression-specify` : Verify found regression requiring re-run from specify step
- `regression-plan` : Verify found regression requiring re-run from plan step
- `regression-implement` : Verify found regression requiring re-run from implement step

### Special Flags (Detail/Notes column)

| Flag | Set By | Meaning | Impact |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| `⚠️ RUNTIME-DEGRADED` | implement (MCP unavailable) | Feature was implemented without runtime verification | verify Phase 3 BLOCKS if MCP is still unavailable — requires user acknowledgment |
| `⚠️ NEVER-RUNTIME-VERIFIED — [reason]` | verify (MCP still unavailable) | User acknowledged no runtime verification will be done | Recorded for traceability. Not blocking further pipeline steps |
| `⚠️ RUNTIME-ERRORS-ACKNOWLEDGED — [reason]` | implement (Runtime Error Zero Gate) | User acknowledged runtime errors exist but chose to proceed | verify Phase 1 will still check; recorded for traceability |
| `⚠️ FOUNDATION-OVERRIDE — [reason]` | pipeline (Foundation Gate) | User overrode a BLOCKING Foundation check failure | Foundation issues may surface during Feature verification |

### Verify Progress

> Written by verify at start, updated after each Phase. Survives context compaction.
> Deleted when verify completes (replaced by final result in Notes).

Format (in Feature Detail Log, below the Step table):

```
#### Verify Progress
| Phase | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Phase 0 | ✅ complete | App started, CDP active |
| Phase 1 | ✅ complete | Tests 228/228, Build ✅, Lint ✅ |
| Phase 2 | ✅ complete | SBI 30/30, Cross-feature ✅ |
| Phase 3 | ⏳ pending | — |
| Phase 3b | ⏳ pending | — |
| Phase 4 | ⏳ pending | — |

⚠️ RESUME FROM: Phase 3 — Read commands/verify-phases.md § Phase 3
```

**Status values**: `⏳ pending`, `🔄 in_progress`, `✅ complete`, `❌ failed`, `⏭️ skipped`

**Lifecycle**: Created at verify start → Updated per Phase → Deleted at verify completion (success/failure recorded in Notes)

**Purpose**: When context compaction occurs during verify, the agent loses in-memory progress tracking. On resumption, the agent reads sdd-state.md (which is always read at session start), finds the Verify Progress table, and resumes from the first pending Phase without re-running completed Phases.

### Minor Fix Accumulator

> Tracks cumulative Minor fixes per module during verify. Persisted to survive context compaction.
> Written after each approved Minor fix. Read by Resumption Protocol.
> Deleted when verify completes (same lifecycle as Verify Progress).

Format (in Feature Detail Log, below the Verify Process Rules):

```
#### Minor Fix Accumulator (re-read after compaction)
| Module | Fix Count | Fix Descriptions |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| src/services/knowledge/ | 2 | Bug #1: loader path, Bug #4: PDF parser |
```

**Lifecycle**: Created at verify start (empty) → Updated after each approved Minor fix → Deleted at verify completion.
**Escalation**: If any module's Fix Count reaches 3, auto-escalate to Major-Implement per Bug Fix Severity Rule.

### Impact Analysis Log

> Records cross-Feature impact analysis results when spec/plan changes affect downstream Features.
> Written by: Step-Back Protocol (pipeline.md), reset --from specify/plan (reset.md), cascading-update spec-level changes.
> Read by: downstream Feature pipeline resumption (to understand why 🔀 was applied).

Format (in Feature Detail Log, below Minor Fix Accumulator or Step table):

```
#### Impact Analysis Log
| Date | Trigger | Changes | Affected | Classification | Action |
|------|---------|---------|----------|---------------|--------|
| 2024-01-20 | step-back to specify | User.email type String→Email | F002, F003 | 🔴 BREAKING | 🔀 from plan |
| 2024-01-20 | step-back to specify | User.avatar_url added (optional) | F002, F005 | 🟡 ADDITIVE | no action |
| 2024-01-20 | step-back to specify | auth rate limiting changed | — | 🟢 INTERNAL | — |
```

**Lifecycle**: Created on first impact analysis → Appended on subsequent analyses → Persists permanently (audit trail).

---

## Feature Mapping

Mapping table between Feature ID, spec-kit Feature Name (directory name), and git branch. The `short-name` portion MUST be identical across smart-sdd Feature ID and spec-kit Name (e.g., `F001-auth` ↔ `001-auth`).

| Feature ID | spec-kit Name | spec-kit Path | Branch | Merged |
|------------|---------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| F001 | 001-auth | specs/001-auth/ | 001-auth | ✅ |
| F002 | 002-product | specs/002-product/ | 002-product | |

> **Population timing**: Feature ID is set when Feature is created (init/add). spec-kit Name, Path, and Branch are set after `specify` completes (spec-kit creates the branch during specify). Merged is set to ✅ after `merge` completes.

---

## Global Evolution Log

Update history of Global Evolution Layer files.

| Date/Time | Trigger Feature | Target File | Change Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 2024-01-16 | F001-auth (plan) | entity-registry.md | Finalized User, Session entities applied |
| 2024-01-17 | F001-auth (implement) | pre-context.md (F002) | Updated entity/API drafts to match actual implementation |

---

## Restructure Log

Feature restructuring history. Recorded when Feature structure is modified (see `reference/restructure-guide.md`).

| Date/Time | Operation | Details | Affected Features |
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 2024-01-20T14:00:00 | merge | F004-cart + F005-wishlist → F004-shopping | F004 (restructured), F005 (removed), F006 (dependency updated) |
| 2024-01-22T10:00:00 | split | F003-product → F003-product-catalog + F008-product-search | F003 (restructured), F008 (created), F006 (dependency updated) |

---

## Parity Check Log

Parity check execution history. Recorded when `/smart-sdd parity` is executed. Only applicable to brownfield rebuild projects (Origin: `rebuild`).

| Date/Time | Source Path | Structural Parity | Logic Parity | Gaps Found | New Features | Exclusions | Deferred | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 2024-02-01T10:00:00 | /Users/dev/old-project | 95.6% | 90.5% | 8 | 2 | 3 | 1 | completed |

---

## Source Behavior Coverage

Tracks mapping from Source Behavior Inventory (SBI) entries to Functional Requirements. Populated for projects with Origin `rebuild` or `adoption`, and also when `/smart-sdd add` creates NEW behaviors.

| SBI | Priority | Origin | FR | Feature | Status |
|-----|----------|--------|----|---------|--------|
| B001 | P1 | extracted | FR-001 | F001-auth | ✅ verified |
| B050 | P2 | new | FR-003 | F009-notif | 🔄 in_progress |

**Summary (extracted only — original source coverage):**
P1: 15/15 (100%) ✅
P2: 22/28 (79%) ⚠️
P3: 5/12 (42%)
Overall: 42/55 (76%)

**NEW behaviors:** 1 total (0 verified, 1 in_progress)

### SBI Status Values
- `✅ verified` : Mapped to FR-###, Feature verify passed
- `🔄 in_progress` : Mapped to FR-###, Feature not yet verified
- `❌ unmapped` : No FR-### mapping exists yet
- `🔒 deferred` : Outside current Active Tiers (core scope only)

### SBI Origin Values
- `extracted` : Behavior extracted from original source code during `/reverse-spec` Phase 2/4
- `new` : Behavior defined by user during `/smart-sdd add` Phase 4 (not present in original source)

### Coverage Policy
- **P1 behaviors: 100% coverage mandatory** regardless of scope mode (applies to Origin=`extracted` only)
- P2/P3 not in Active Tiers → `deferred` status
- After Core completion, deferred items become incremental candidates
- **NEW entries** (Origin=`new`): Tracked separately from original source coverage metrics. They do NOT affect the extracted P1/P2/P3 percentages. NEW coverage is reported as a separate "NEW behaviors" line

---

## Demo Group Progress

Tracks demo groups defined in `roadmap.md`. Each group represents a user scenario that spans multiple Features. Only populated when Demo Groups exist in the roadmap.

| Group | Scenario | Features | Completed | Status | Last Demo |
|-------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| DG-01 | User Purchase Flow | F001,F002,F003,F005 | 3/4 | ⏳ F005 pending | — |
| DG-02 | Admin Dashboard | F001,F004,F006 | 1/3 | ⏳ F004,F006 pending | 2024-01-20 |

### Demo Group Status Values
- `✅ All verified` : All Features in group verified; Integration Demo completed
- `⏳ [Feature list] pending` : Waiting for listed Features to complete verify
- `⏳ [Feature list] deferred` : Features are outside Active Tiers (core scope); activate via `/smart-sdd expand`
- `🔄 re-run needed ([reason])` : Integration Demo invalidated (e.g., new Feature added to group)

### Integration Demo Trigger
When the last pending Feature in a group completes verify, display HARD STOP:
"All Features in [Group] verified. Run Integration Demo for [Scenario]?"
For the full execution procedure and result recording, see `reference/demo-standard.md` § 7.

### Integration Demo Invalidation
When a Feature is added to an existing demo group (via incremental `add`):
- Previous Integration Demo result is invalidated
- Status changes to `🔄 re-run needed (F00N added)`
- Re-triggered when all Features (including new one) are verified

## Constitution Update Log

Constitution incremental update history.

| Version | Date/Time | Trigger | Change Description |
|---------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 1.0.0 | 2024-01-15 | Initial finalization | Finalized based on constitution-seed |
| 1.1.0 | 2024-01-17 | F001-auth implement | Added authentication middleware pattern principle |
```

## Initial State Generation

When smart-sdd runs for the first time (when sdd-state.md does not exist), the initial state is generated using the following procedure:

1. Read `BASE_PATH/roadmap.md` to extract the Feature list and Tiers
2. Initialize all steps of all Features to `pending` (blank)
3. Leave the Feature Mapping table empty; map the spec-kit Name and Branch when each Feature's specify step is completed (spec-kit creates the branch during specify)
4. Initialize Constitution to `pending`
5. Set Domain Profile based on the `--profile` argument (or `--domain` for backward compatibility). Resolve via `domains/_resolver.md`
5b. Set Archetype from Proposal inference (A0 keyword matching) or user selection during init. Default `"none"` if no archetype is detected or selected. For rebuild/adoption: archetype may be auto-detected from constitution-seed during pipeline Phase 0
6. Set Origin based on how artifacts were generated:
   - `greenfield` — if initialized by `/smart-sdd init`
   - `rebuild` — if initialized from `/reverse-spec` artifacts for rebuild workflow (`/smart-sdd pipeline`)
   - `adoption` — if initialized from `/reverse-spec` artifacts for adoption workflow (`/smart-sdd adopt`)
   - Origin does not change when Features are added later via `/smart-sdd add`
6b. Set Structure based on project analysis:
   - `monorepo` — if Turbo, Lerna, Nx, or Bun/pnpm/Yarn workspaces detected (multiple `package.json` files in subdirectories, or `workspaces` field in root `package.json`); or Python workspace signals (multiple `pyproject.toml` + `[tool.uv.workspace]` / `[tool.poetry.packages]` / Pants/Bazel BUILD); or Rust workspace (`Cargo.toml` with `[workspace]` + `members`); or Go workspace (`go.work` + multiple `go.mod`); or Java/Maven multi-module (parent `pom.xml` with `<modules>`, child `pom.xml` with `<parent>`); or Java/Gradle multi-module (`settings.gradle`/`settings.gradle.kts` with `include` statements)
   - `single-package` — default for all other projects
   - For `rebuild` / `adoption`: auto-detected from source project structure during `/reverse-spec` Phase 1
   - For `greenfield`: set based on init project configuration (default `single-package`)
7. Set Source Path based on the project mode:
   - `greenfield` → `N/A` (no existing source code)
   - `rebuild` / `adoption` → Extract from the `**Source**:` field in `BASE_PATH/roadmap.md` (the original target-directory path used during `/reverse-spec`)
   - `add` (incremental) → `.` (source is the current working directory)
8. Set Scope:
   - `rebuild` → Read from `**Strategy**: Scope: [core|full]` in `BASE_PATH/roadmap.md`
   - `adoption` → Always `full` (must document everything)
   - `greenfield` (init) → Always `full`
   - If roadmap.md has no Scope info (legacy projects) → Default to `full`
9. Set Active Tiers based on Scope:
   - `core` → `T1` (only Tier 1 Features are initially active)
   - `full` → omit the `Active Tiers` field entirely (all Features are active, no Tier concept)
10. Set initial Feature Status:
   - `core` → Features whose Tier is in Active Tiers → `pending` (blank), others → `deferred`
   - `full` → all Features → `pending` (no deferred Features, no Tier column in progress table)
11. Set Clarity Index (greenfield only — from Proposal Mode):
   - If init used Proposal Mode: write CI percentage, per-dimension scores, and low-confidence list
   - If init used Standard Mode (full Q&A): set CI to `N/A` (user provided all info interactively)
   - `rebuild` / `adoption`: always `N/A` (CI not applicable — project already exists)

## State Update Rules

### When a Step Starts
- Change the corresponding cell to 🔄
- Record the start time in the Feature Detail Log
- Change the Feature Progress Status to `in_progress`

### When a Step Completes
- Change the corresponding cell to ✅ MM-DD
- Record the completion time and notes in the Feature Detail Log
- Update `Last Updated`

### When a Step Fails
- Change the corresponding cell to ❌
- Record the failure reason in the Feature Detail Log
- Feature Progress Status remains `in_progress` (retry is possible)
- Update `Last Updated`

### When a Feature Completes (all steps including merge ✅)
- Change the Feature Progress Status to `completed`
- Mark the Feature as `✅` in the Merged column of the Feature Mapping table
- Add update history to the Global Evolution Log

### When a Feature is Adopted (adoption pipeline — all adopt steps including merge ✅)
- Change the Feature Progress Status to `adopted` (NOT `completed`)
- Mark the Feature as `✅` in the Merged column of the Feature Mapping table
- Add update history to the Global Evolution Log
- Note: `adopted` Features have no `tasks` or `implement` steps — these columns show `⏭️` (skipped)

### When Verify Completes in Adoption Mode
- Test failure → record as "pre-existing issue" in Notes (NOT a blocker)
- No tests present → record as "no tests — baseline" in Notes (NOT a blocker)
- Build/lint failure → record only; adoption's purpose is documentation, not code changes
- Set verify step icon to `⚠️` if any pre-existing issues found, `✅` otherwise
- Notes format: `Tests: [result]; Build: [result]; Pre-existing: [count] issues`

### When a Step is Skipped (e.g., analyze has no CRITICAL issues)
- Change the corresponding cell to ⏭️
- Record the skip reason in the Feature Detail Log
- Update `Last Updated`

> **Note on `clarify`**: `clarify` is a conditional sub-step of `specify` — it runs only when ambiguity markers are found in the spec. It is NOT tracked as a separate column in the Feature Progress table. If clarify was executed, note it in the Feature Detail Log under the `specify` row (e.g., "5 FRs, 8 SCs (clarify executed)").

### When Constitution is Finalized (Phase 0 completion)
- Set Constitution Status to `completed`
- Set Constitution Version to the version from the generated file (e.g., `1.0.0`)
- Set Constitution Completed At to current ISO 8601 timestamp
- Set Constitution Updates to `0`
- Add entry to Constitution Update Log: version, date, "Initial finalization"
- Update `Last Updated`

### When Constitution is Incrementally Updated (during Feature pipeline)
- Increment Constitution Version (MINOR bump, e.g., `1.0.0` → `1.1.0`)
- Increment Constitution Updates count
- Add entry to Constitution Update Log: new version, date, trigger Feature, change description
- Update `Last Updated`

### When Scope is Expanded (via /smart-sdd expand — core scope only)
- Update the `Active Tiers` field to the new value (e.g., `T1` → `T1,T2`)
- Change `deferred` Features whose Tier matches the newly activated Tiers to `pending`
- Record the expansion in Global Evolution Log: "Scope expanded: T1 → T1,T2"
- Note: This rule only applies to `core` scope projects. `full` scope has no deferred Features.
- Update `Last Updated`

### When Features are Added (via /smart-sdd add)
- Add new Feature rows to Feature Progress table (all step cells blank, Status = `pending`)
- Add new Feature rows to Feature Mapping table (Feature ID filled, spec-kit Name/Path/Branch blank until specify)
- Record "Feature F{NNN}-{name} added" in Global Evolution Log
- Update `Last Updated`

### When Parity Check is Executed (via /smart-sdd parity)
- Add a new entry to the Parity Check Log with:
  - Date/time of execution
  - Source path used (resolved from `--source` argument or sdd-state.md)
  - Structural and logic parity percentages
  - Number of gaps found, new Features created, intentional exclusions, and deferred items
  - Status: `completed` or `in_progress`
- If new Features were created via the `add` workflow:
  - Add new Feature rows to Feature Progress table with all steps blank (`pending`)
  - Record "Feature F00N-name added via parity check" in Global Evolution Log
- If existing Features were flagged for re-execution:
  - Mark affected steps with 🔀 from specify onward in Feature Progress table
  - Change Feature Status to `restructured`
  - Record in Restructure Log: "parity-driven re-specification for F00N-name"
- Update `Last Updated`

### When SBI Coverage Changes (after specify or verify — rebuild/adoption only)
- After `specify` completes: scan spec.md for `[source: B###]` tags → update Source Behavior Coverage table (SBI → FR → Feature mapping, Status → `🔄 in_progress`)
- After `verify` completes: update matched SBI entries to `✅ verified`
- Recalculate P1/P2/P3 summary percentages
- If P1 coverage < 100% after all Active Tier Features are verified: display warning

### When Demo Group Progress Changes (after verify)
- After `verify` completes: check if the verified Feature is the last pending Feature in any demo group
- If yes → update Demo Group Status to `✅ All verified` and display Integration Demo trigger (HARD STOP)
- If no → update completed count (e.g., `3/4`)
- When a Feature is added to an existing group via `add`: change group Status to `🔄 re-run needed (F00N added)`

### When a Feature is Restructured (see reference/restructure-guide.md)
- Change affected step cells to 🔀 (all steps from the first affected step onward)
- Change Feature Progress Status to `restructured`
- Record the restructure operation in the Restructure Log
- If the Feature is **deleted**: remove the row from Feature Progress table entirely
- If a **new Feature** is created (e.g., split): add a new row with all steps blank (`pending`)
- If a Feature is **merged** into another: remove the absorbed Feature's row; update the surviving Feature's row
- Update `Last Updated`

### When a Restructured Feature Resumes
- When a 🔀 step starts execution, follow normal "When a Step Starts" rules (🔀 → 🔄)
- The 🔀 is replaced by 🔄, then ✅ upon completion
- When all 🔀 steps are re-executed successfully, change Status from `restructured` to `in_progress` or `completed` as appropriate

### When Verify Step Completes — Result Recording

When the verify step is completed, record the following information in the Notes column of the Feature Detail Log:

```
Tests: [passed count]/[total count] passed
Build: [success/failure]
Lint: [success/failure/not configured]
Cross-Feature: [verification point count] checked, [issue count] issues
```

**If limited verification was acknowledged** (user selected "Acknowledge limited verification" in Phase 1 or Phase 3):
- Set the verify step icon to `⚠️` (not ✅) in Feature Progress
- Append to Notes: `⚠️ LIMITED — [reason]` and/or `⚠️ DEMO-LIMITED — [reason]`
- The overall verify status is `limited` (not `success`) — merge is allowed with a reminder
- Example Notes: `Tests: 12/12 passed; Build: success; ⚠️ DEMO-LIMITED — No frontend; pure data layer library`

### When Clarity Index Updates (greenfield only)

> CI is set during init Proposal Mode and may improve as the pipeline progresses. CI never decreases.
> Full specification: `reference/clarity-index.md` § 6.

- After `init` Proposal Mode — initial scoring: write initial CI to header
- After `init` Proposal Mode — after clarification: update CI with improved scores
- After `add` — Features defined: update Key Capabilities dimension based on Feature count and specificity
- After `specify` — spec.md generated: partial update (constraints/capabilities refined from spec details)
- **CI never decreases**: Only dimensions that improve are updated; scores never drop
- `rebuild` / `adoption` origins: CI remains `N/A` throughout (existing project, no inference needed)

### Monorepo-specific State

When `**Structure**: monorepo`:
- **Toolchain section**: commands may include workspace filter (e.g., `turbo run build`, `bun run --filter=core test`)
- **Feature Progress**: Features may span multiple packages — Notes column records affected packages
- **Foundation Gate**: runs workspace-aware build check (`turbo run build` or equivalent)
- **Verify Phase 1**: runs workspace-aware test/lint (per-package or aggregated based on toolchain)
