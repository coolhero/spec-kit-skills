# Verify Command — Phase Details

> Read after `/smart-sdd verify [FID]` is invoked. For Common Protocol (Checkpoint, Review), see `pipeline.md`.
> For per-command injection rules, see `reference/injection/verify.md`.
>
> **⚠️ Context Budget Note**: This file is ~2000 lines. Read the full file once at verify start,
> then reference specific Phase sections as needed during execution. Do NOT re-read the entire file
> for each Phase — read Phase 0 when executing Phase 0, Phase 3 when executing Phase 3, etc.
>
> **Adoption mode**: If `sdd-state.md` Origin is `adoption`, read `reference/injection/adopt-verify.md` instead of `reference/injection/verify.md`. Key differences: Phase 1 failures are **non-blocking** (pre-existing issues), Phase 3 is **skipped** (adoption has no per-Feature demos), and Feature status is `adopted` (not `completed`).

## Verify Command

Running `/smart-sdd verify [FID]` performs post-implementation verification. This step runs **after implement** to validate that the actual code works correctly and is consistent with the broader project.

### Bug Fix Severity Rule — verify is for FINDING, not REWRITING

When verify discovers a bug (or the user provides feedback during Review), classify its severity and **route to the correct pipeline stage**:

| Severity | Examples | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Minor** | Missing import, typo, null check, off-by-one, missing CSS class, simple config fix | ✅ Fix inline during verify — commit as `fix:` |
| **Major-Implement** | Frozen object pattern change, missing component, state flow restructuring, new module needed | ❌ Return to **implement** — re-run affected tasks with issue context |
| **Major-Plan** | Wrong architecture pattern, missing data model field, API contract mismatch, component structure redesign needed | ❌ Return to **plan** — re-run speckit-plan with updated constraints |
| **Major-Spec** | Missing functional requirement, wrong success criteria, scope gap, requirement misinterpretation | ❌ Return to **specify** — re-run speckit-specify with corrected requirements |

**How to classify**:
- **Minor**: Fix touches ≤2 files, no API/interface change, no architectural reasoning needed
- **Major-Implement**: Fix touches 3+ files OR needs a new component, but spec and plan are correct
- **Major-Plan**: The plan's architecture, data model, or contracts need revision (spec is correct, but the plan made wrong choices)
- **Major-Spec**: The requirements themselves are wrong or incomplete (everything downstream — plan, tasks, implement — is built on wrong assumptions)

**When any Major issue is found**:
1. Record the issue in the verify result report with full details and the recommended regression target
2. Display: `🔴 [Severity] issue detected — requires pipeline regression to [target stage]`
3. Set verify status to `failure` with the issue description and regression target
4. **HARD STOP** — Use AskUserQuestion:
   - "Return to [target stage] with issue context" — pipeline regression with preserved context
   - "Reclassify severity and fix now" — user overrides severity classification
   **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

**Pipeline regression handling** (when user confirms "Return to [stage]"):
1. Record regression reason in `sdd-state.md` Feature Detail Log: `↩️ REGRESSION to [stage] — [reason]`
2. Set Feature status to `regression-[stage]` (e.g., `regression-specify`, `regression-plan`)
3. Preserve current verify results as context — the re-run starts with knowledge of what went wrong
4. Display: `↩️ Returning to [stage] for [FID]. Verify results preserved as regression context.`
5. Resume pipeline from the selected stage — all subsequent steps (specify → plan → tasks → implement → verify) re-execute

**Regression depth limit**:
Track regression count per Feature in the Feature Detail Log. Each `↩️ REGRESSION` entry increments the counter.
- After **2 regressions** for the same Feature (regardless of severity target): HARD STOP
  **Use AskUserQuestion**: "Feature [FID] has regressed 2 times. How to proceed?"
  - "Continue with 3rd regression" — allow one more attempt
  - "Abort Feature — mark as blocked" — set status to `blocked`, move to next Feature
  - "Manual review — pause pipeline" — pause for user investigation
  **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)
- After **3 regressions**: Force block. Set status to `blocked`, display: `🚫 Feature [FID] blocked after 3 regressions. Manual intervention required.`
- Regression counter is tracked per-Feature, not per-session (persisted in sdd-state.md Feature Detail Log by counting `↩️ REGRESSION` entries)

**Rationale**: verify-phase fixes bypass spec/plan/tasks and have no checkpoint/review. Quick-patching a Major issue leads to suboptimal architecture — the kind of code that works but accumulates tech debt. Additionally, user feedback during verify Review often identifies issues that are not bugs but rather spec-level or plan-level problems. Without structured regression routing, these fixes happen ad-hoc, outside the pipeline's quality gates.

### Verify-time Change Recording — All Source Modifications

The Bug Fix Severity Rule above handles **bugs** (wrong behavior). But verify may also discover **implementation gaps** — missing behavior that falls within the scope of an existing FR-### or task but was not completed during implement. Unlike a bug, an implementation gap is *absent* behavior, not *wrong* behavior (e.g., missing i18n keys, unimplemented edge case within a documented SC, missing config entry referenced in tasks).

**Classification of ALL source modifications during verify**:

| Change Type | Scope Test | Action |
|-------------|-----------|--------|
| Bug Fix (Minor) | Wrong behavior, ≤2 files, no API change | Fix inline (per Bug Fix Severity Rule) |
| Implementation Gap | Missing behavior within existing FR/task scope, ≤2 files, no API change | Fix inline + record as gap fill |
| Design Change | New behavior beyond FR/task scope, OR 3+ files, OR API/contract change | Pipeline regression (per Bug Fix Severity Rule Major-*) |

**Decision flow** (when modifying source during verify):
1. Is this fixing **wrong** behavior? → Bug Fix → Apply Bug Fix Severity Rule
2. Is this adding **missing** behavior within an existing FR/task?
   - ≤2 files, no API/interface change → **Implementation Gap** — fix inline + record
   - 3+ files OR API change → **Major-Implement** regression
3. Is this adding behavior **beyond** existing FR/task scope? → **Design Change** → Major-* regression

**Recording requirement** (in sdd-state.md Notes after verify completes):
All inline changes (Minor bug fixes + Implementation gap fills) must be summarized in the Notes column. This recording ensures:
- **Transparency**: user sees what was changed during verify beyond the planned verification
- **Audit trail**: if a "gap fill" was actually a scope expansion, the record enables review
- **Pattern detection**: repeated gap fills in the same area suggest implement phase quality issues

Format: `Inline changes: [N] bug fix, [N] gap fill ([brief descriptions])`

### Source Modification Gate (MANDATORY — enforced before ANY source file change)

> **Why this gate exists**: The Bug Fix Severity Rule and Verify-time Change Classification above are reference rules. In practice, agents skip them due to "fix it now" bias — they discover an issue and immediately modify code without first evaluating severity. This gate is the enforcement mechanism that BLOCKS source modification until classification is completed and displayed.

**RULE: Before editing ANY source file (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.vue`, `.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.java`, `.jsx`, `.svelte`, etc.) during verify, the agent MUST execute this gate. No exceptions.**

**Gate procedure**:

1. **STOP** — do NOT open any source file for editing yet.

2. **List ALL planned changes** in a visible table:
   ```
   🔍 Source Modification Gate — Pre-Fix Classification:
   | # | File | What changes | Why |
   |---|------|-------------|-----|
   Example:
   | 1 | tools/index.ts | KB picker popover structure | SC-007a: picker doesn't open |
   | 2 | types/knowledge.ts | Add KnowledgeReference.name field | CitationBlock needs name for display |
   | 3 | KnowledgeService.ts | getKnowledgeReferences() return shape | Include name in returned data |
   | 4 | CitationBlock.tsx | Render name from reference | Display citation source name |
   ```

3. **Apply classification per change** (using Decision Flow above):
   - Each row: Bug Fix / Implementation Gap / Design Change
   - Each row: file count contribution

4. **AGGREGATE file count check**: Count TOTAL unique files across ALL planned changes.
   - Total ≤ 2 files, no API/interface change, no state restructure → **Minor/Gap — proceed inline**
   - Total ≥ 3 files → **Major-Implement** (regardless of individual change sizes)
   - ANY change involves API/contract change → **Major-Plan**
   - ANY change involves state flow restructure or new module → **Major-Implement**
   - ANY change adds behavior beyond existing FR/task scope → **Major-* regression**

   > **Critical**: Do NOT evaluate each change in isolation. Evaluate the AGGREGATE. Four "small" changes across 4 files = Major-Implement, not four Minor fixes.

5. **Display classification result**:
   ```
   ⚙️ Classification: [Minor — proceed inline] OR [🔴 Major-Implement — pipeline regression required]
     Total files: [N]
     API/interface change: [yes/no]
     State restructure: [yes/no]
   ```

6. **HARD STOP — User Approval Gate** (MANDATORY for ALL classifications, including Minor):

   > **Why Minor also requires approval**: A known failure pattern involves repeated Minor fixes accumulating into de facto Major rewrites without user awareness. By making ALL classifications visible and requiring approval, the user can detect when "Minor" fixes are actually a deeper problem before any files are touched.

   Display the classification table from step 2 with the aggregate result from step 5, then:

   **If Minor/Gap classification** — **Use AskUserQuestion**:
   ```
   🔍 Source Modification Gate — Approval Required:
   [Classification table from step 2]

   ⚙️ Aggregate: [Minor/Gap] — [N] files, no API change
   ```
   - "Approve — proceed with inline fix"
   - "Reclassify as Major — pipeline regression"
   - "Skip — do not modify source files"
   **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

   **If Major classification** → Proceed directly to step 8 (Major HARD STOP) for pipeline regression routing.

7. **If user approves Minor/Gap** → Before writing code, execute **Source Reference for Verify Fixes** (rebuild mode only), then proceed with inline fixes. Record all changes in Notes. **Then execute Post-Fix Runtime Verification** (step 9 below).

   **Source Reference for Verify Fixes (rebuild mode — BLOCKING)**:
   > **Why this exists**: In rebuild mode, verify fixes often degrade into "improvise based on error messages" — the agent patches symptoms without understanding the source app's original implementation. This produces a fix → re-fix → re-re-fix loop that eventually requires "start from scratch." The source app already has a working implementation; read it first.

   Before modifying any file during verify in rebuild mode:
   1. Identify the corresponding source app file(s) from the Source→Target Component Mapping (in plan.md) or pre-context.md Source Reference
   2. **Read those source files** — not just reference them. Actually open and parse the source code.
   3. Display: `📂 Verify Source Ref: [source file] → [target file] — reading before fix`
   4. The fix MUST preserve the source app's patterns unless there's an explicit architectural reason to diverge (documented in plan.md)

   ```
   ❌ WRONG (rebuild verify fix):
     SC-008 citation tooltip not showing → add inline style → still broken
     → add z-index → still broken → refactor CSS → more broken
     → "처음부터 다시"

   ✅ RIGHT (rebuild verify fix):
     SC-008 citation tooltip not showing
     → Read source CitationTooltip.tsx → understand positioning logic
     → Read source citation.ts → understand data flow
     → Implement fix based on source pattern → verify → done
   ```

   **Skip if**: Source Path = `N/A` (greenfield) or fix is in a file with no source counterpart (new file not in Source→Target mapping).

8. **If Major** → **HARD STOP**. Do NOT modify any source files. Trigger the "When any Major issue is found" flow (lines 31-38):
   - Display `🔴 [Severity] issue detected — requires pipeline regression to [target stage]`
   - **Use AskUserQuestion**:
     - "Return to [target stage] with issue context"
     - "Reclassify severity and fix now" — user overrides
   - **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

9. **Post-Fix Runtime Verification** (MANDATORY after every inline fix):

   > "Build passes + tests pass ≠ fix is correct." An inline fix during verify MUST be runtime-verified, not just statically validated. This catches the pattern where code compiles but the fix doesn't actually resolve the runtime issue (e.g., service exists but isn't wired in, type is correct but data doesn't flow).

   After applying an inline fix (Minor bug fix or Gap fill):
   1. **Build check**: Run build → confirm no errors introduced
   2. **Test check**: Run tests → confirm no regressions
   3. **Runtime verification of the specific fix**:
      - Identify the SC(s) affected by the fix
      - Re-run the affected SC verification using the appropriate backend (Playwright MCP/CLI, HTTP client, process runner)
      - The fix is NOT complete until the affected SC passes at its Required Depth (from SC Verification Matrix)
      - If runtime verification fails after the fix → the fix is insufficient. Re-evaluate: is this actually Minor, or has the scope grown to Major?
   4. **Display result**:
      ```
      🔧 Post-Fix Verification:
        Build: ✅ | Tests: ✅ | Runtime SC-022: ✅ Tier 2 reached
        Fix confirmed — recording in Notes.
      ```
      OR:
      ```
      🔧 Post-Fix Verification:
        Build: ✅ | Tests: ✅ | Runtime SC-022: ❌ still failing
        ⚠️ Fix did not resolve runtime issue. Re-evaluating severity...
      ```
   5. If runtime re-verification fails AND investigation reveals more files need changes → **re-run the Source Modification Gate** with the expanded scope. The aggregate file count may now push the fix to Major.

10. **Minor Fix Accumulator** (cross-gate tracking):

   The Source Modification Gate evaluates each fix batch independently. But a pattern of repeated Minor fixes in the same area indicates a deeper structural issue that should be handled by implement, not verify.

   **Rule**: Track all inline fixes applied during this verify session. If **3 or more Minor fixes** (bug fix or gap fill) accumulate in the **same module/component** (same directory or same logical boundary), auto-escalate to **Major-Implement**:
   ```
   🔴 Minor Fix Accumulator triggered:
     Module: src/services/{module}/
     Fixes applied: 3 (Bug #1: path resolution, Bug #4: parser config, Bug #5: API format)
     → Auto-escalated to Major-Implement — this module needs redesign in implement, not patchwork in verify.
   ```
   After auto-escalation → trigger the Major HARD STOP flow (step 8 above).

   **Module boundary definition**: Files sharing the same parent directory OR the same service/component name (e.g., `UserService.ts`, `UserLoader.ts`, `UserStore.ts` = same `User` module even if in different directories).

   **SC Re-Fix Loop Detection**: If the same SC fails Post-Fix Runtime Verification (step 9) **2 times** after 2 different fix attempts, auto-escalate to **Major-Implement**:
   ```
   🔴 SC Re-Fix Loop detected:
     SC-008 (citation tooltip) — failed after fix attempt #1 (z-index), failed after fix attempt #2 (CSS refactor)
     → The fix approach is wrong, not just incomplete. Return to implement with source analysis.
   ```
   This prevents the "fix → re-fix → re-re-fix → start from scratch" degradation pattern. Two failed attempts = the problem needs implement-level redesign, not verify-level patching.

**This gate applies to ALL verify phases**: Phase 1 re-fixes, Phase 2 fixes, Phase 3 SC failure fixes, Phase 3b fixes, and post-Review user-requested fixes. There are NO exceptions.

### Verify Initialization — Compaction-Safe Checkpoint

Before any Phase execution, write the Verify Progress table AND Process Rules Checklist to sdd-state.md:

1. Read sdd-state.md → Feature Detail Log for this Feature
2. **Check for existing Verify Progress**:
   - If exists with pending phases → **Resumption Protocol** (see below)
   - If not exists → write fresh Verify Progress table with all phases as `⏳ pending`
3. Set `⚠️ RESUME FROM: Phase 0` line
4. **Write Process Rules Checklist** (survives context compaction — agent re-reads sdd-state.md after compaction):
   ```
   #### Verify Process Rules (re-read after compaction)
   - [ ] Source Modification Gate: BEFORE editing ANY source file → list changes → classify → aggregate → **HARD STOP AskUserQuestion for ALL classifications** (Minor AND Major) → user must approve before any edit
   - [ ] Minor Accumulator: 3+ Minor fixes in same module → auto-escalate to Major. State persisted in `#### Minor Fix Accumulator` — re-read after compaction.
   - [ ] Post-Fix Runtime Verification: after inline fix → build + test + runtime SC re-verify at Required Depth
   - [ ] SC Decomposition: mixed SCs → split into sub-SCs (auto + user-assisted)
   - [ ] Per-SC Depth Tracking: record Reached Depth vs Required Depth for each SC
   - [ ] Inline changes recording: all source modifications during verify → Notes column
   ```
   This checklist is written to sdd-state.md as plain text, ensuring it persists across context compaction boundaries. The Resumption Protocol (below) includes re-reading this checklist as step 1.

5. **Write Minor Fix Accumulator state** (survives context compaction):
   ```
   #### Minor Fix Accumulator (re-read after compaction)
   | Module | Fix Count | Fix Descriptions |
   |--------|-----------|-----------------|
   ```
   Initially empty. Updated after each approved Minor fix with the module name, incremented count, and brief description. If count reaches 3 for any module, auto-escalate per step 10.

**After each Phase completes**: Update the Phase's Status to `✅ complete` and write Result summary.
Update `⚠️ RESUME FROM` to point to the next pending Phase.

**On verify completion** (success or failure):
- Delete the `#### Verify Progress` section from sdd-state.md
- Delete the `#### Verify Process Rules` section from sdd-state.md
- Delete the `#### Minor Fix Accumulator` section from sdd-state.md
- Write final result to Notes column as before

---

### Pre-Resumption Validation (run before Resumption Protocol)

Before resuming verify from saved state:
1. **sdd-state.md readable**: File exists, markdown parses, State Schema Version present
2. **Verify Progress table exists**: Feature Detail Log has `### Verify Progress` for current Feature
3. **Process Rules Checklist exists**: `#### Verify Process Rules` section present
4. **Minor Fix Accumulator exists**: `#### Minor Fix Accumulator` section present (may be empty)
5. **Phase status consistency**: No phase marked `🔄 in_progress` (should have been saved as `⏳ pending` or `✅`)

If ANY check fails:
- Display: "Verify state integrity issue: {specific problem}"
- **Use AskUserQuestion**: "Verify state has issues. How to proceed?"
  - Options: "Reset verify from Phase 0", "Attempt auto-repair", "Abort verify"
- **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)
- Auto-repair: re-create missing sections with `⏳ pending` status

---

### Resumption Protocol — After Context Compaction

If sdd-state.md contains `#### Verify Progress` with pending phases:

1. **Re-read this file** (commands/verify-phases.md) — MANDATORY
2. **Re-read reference/injection/verify.md** — for Checkpoint/Review display format
3. **Re-read `#### Verify Process Rules`** from sdd-state.md — MANDATORY. These rules survive compaction and MUST be followed for the remainder of the verify session. Pay special attention to the Source Modification Gate and Minor Accumulator.
4. **Re-read `#### Minor Fix Accumulator`** from sdd-state.md — MANDATORY. Restore accumulator state. If any module already has 2 fixes, the NEXT Minor fix in that module triggers auto-escalation.
5. **Identify resume point**: First phase with `⏳ pending` or `🔄 in_progress` status
6. **Re-establish prerequisites**:
   - Run Pre-flight Clean Slate (port check) — previous session's processes may be orphaned
   - If Phase 3 pending and MCP needed → re-run Phase 0 (app start + CDP check)
   - If Phase 1 already complete → do NOT re-run tests/build/lint
7. **Continue from resume point** through remaining phases
8. **Display resume notice**:
   ```
   🔄 Verify resumed from Phase [N] (context compaction detected)
   Previously completed: Phase 0 ✅, Phase 1 ✅, Phase 2 ✅
   Continuing: Phase 3, Phase 3b, Phase 4
   ```

---

### Verify Process Lifecycle Protocol

> Verify launches background processes (app servers, dev servers, Electron instances). Without lifecycle management, failed/aborted verifications leave orphan processes that block ports and corrupt subsequent runs. This protocol ensures deterministic cleanup regardless of how verify ends.

**PID Registry**: Maintain an in-memory list of all PIDs started during this verify session. Every background process launch (Phase 0 app start, 0-2c dev probe, Phase 3 restarts) MUST record its PID.

**Pre-flight Clean Slate** (runs once at verify start, before Phase 0):
1. Read the project's expected ports from constitution/quickstart (e.g., 3000, 5173, 9222, 4173)
2. Check for processes occupying those ports: `lsof -ti :PORT` (macOS/Linux)
3. If processes found:
   - Display: `⚠️ Port [PORT] occupied by PID [PID] ([process name]). Likely residue from a previous session.`
   - Kill the occupying process: `kill $PID` (graceful), wait 2s, `kill -9 $PID` if still alive
   - Display: `🧹 Cleaned up orphan process on port [PORT]`
4. If no conflicts: `✅ All expected ports available`

> **Why port-based, not PID-based**: PID files from previous sessions may be stale (PID recycled by OS). Port occupancy is the ground truth — if something is listening on the app's port, it must be cleared regardless of its origin.

**Cleanup on exit** (runs when verify completes, fails, or is aborted):
1. Iterate the PID registry in reverse order (LIFO — child processes first)
2. For each PID: `kill $PID` (SIGTERM), wait 2s, `kill -9 $PID` (SIGKILL) if still alive
3. Display: `🧹 Cleaned up [N] background processes`

> **Abort scenario**: If verify is interrupted (context compaction, user abort, unrecoverable error), the cleanup may not execute in the same session. The Pre-flight Clean Slate at the start of the NEXT verify session catches these cases — this is why both entry and exit cleanup are needed.

---

### Phase 0: Runtime Environment Readiness (UI Features only)

> Run BEFORE Pre-flight MCP check. Ensures the app can be reached by Playwright.
> Skip for non-UI Features (backend-only, library, CLI — detected from constitution-seed.md or pre-context.md).

**0-1. Build**: Run the project's build command (from `quickstart.md` or constitution).
- Build failure → BLOCK (same as Phase 1 build gate). Do NOT proceed to MCP check.
- Display: `🔨 Building project for runtime verification...`

**0-2. Start Electron App** (Electron projects):
- Read build tool from pre-context/constitution tech stack
- **Primary path (CLI backend)**: Use Playwright `_electron.launch()` API — no CDP needed. The Playwright test runner launches the Electron app directly via the `electron` binary path.
  (e.g., `const app = await _electron.launch({ args: ['out/main/index.js'] })`)
- **Alternative path (MCP backend)**: Start app with CDP: per PLAYWRIGHT-GUIDE.md Electron build tool table
  (e.g., `npx electron-vite preview -- --remote-debugging-port=9222` or `npx electron out/main/index.js --remote-debugging-port=9222`)
  > **Note**: CDP configuration is only required when using Playwright MCP as the backend. CLI mode uses `_electron.launch()` which connects directly without CDP.
- Record PID in the Verify PID Registry (see Process Lifecycle Protocol above)
- Display: `🚀 Starting Electron app...` (CLI mode) or `🚀 Starting Electron app with CDP on port 9222...` (MCP mode)

**0-2 alt. Start Dev Server** (Web projects):
- Start dev server (from `quickstart.md` or `launch.json`)
- Wait for port readiness (poll health endpoint or port, max 30s)
- Record PID in the Verify PID Registry (see Process Lifecycle Protocol above)
- Display: `🚀 Starting dev server...`

**0-2c. Dev Mode Stability Probe** (GUI projects with distinct dev command):

> Production builds and dev mode follow different code paths — module bundling vs native ESM, static env injection vs runtime loading, pre-compiled vs HMR-driven. Bugs that only manifest under one path (e.g., module-scope side effects that depend on initialization order) are invisible if verify only exercises the other. This probe catches startup-time crashes in the path NOT covered by 0-2/0-2alt.

**Skip if**: No dev command detected, or dev command is identical to the production start path already tested above.

**Detection**: Read the project's script configuration (e.g., `package.json` scripts, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`) for a `dev` entry (or `start:dev`, `serve`, etc.). Compare with the production start command used in 0-2/0-2alt. If they invoke different tooling (e.g., `electron-vite dev` vs `electron-vite build && electron .`, or `vite dev` vs `vite build && vite preview`), proceed.

**Procedure**:
1. Run the dev command in background (e.g., `pnpm run dev &`). Record PID.
2. Monitor stderr for ~10 seconds (stability window)
3. **Active survival check**: After the stability window, verify `kill -0 $PID` succeeds. Some crashes (segfault, OOM kill, silent abort) produce no stderr output — the process simply disappears. Passive stderr scanning alone misses these.
4. Scan stderr for crash patterns: `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError`, `Uncaught exception`, `Unhandled rejection`, `panic:`, `FATAL`, `segfault`, process exit with non-zero code
5. Kill the dev process (cleanup). Add PID to the Verify PID Registry (see Process Lifecycle Protocol above).
6. **If process gone (kill -0 fails) OR crash pattern detected**: `⚠️ Dev mode startup crash — [error pattern or "process exited silently"]. Production build may mask initialization-order or environment-dependent bugs.`
   - Result: ⚠️ WARNING (NOT blocking) — included in Phase 3b Bug Prevention results
7. **If process alive AND no crash patterns**: `✅ Dev mode startup stable`
8. Display result and continue to 0-3

> **Note**: This probe tests startup stability only — it does NOT replace the full runtime verification in Phase 3, which uses the production build. The purpose is to surface environment-dependent crashes (module-scope side effects, lifecycle-dependent initialization, missing runtime prerequisites) that differ between dev and production code paths.

**0-3. Verify CDP Connection** (Electron only — MCP backend path):
- Skip this step if `RUNTIME_BACKEND = cli` or `cli-limited` (CLI uses `_electron.launch()`, no CDP needed)
- Run `curl -s http://localhost:9222/json/version`
- Retry: 3 attempts, 3s interval
- All fail → HARD STOP: `CDP connection failed after app start. Check app startup logs.`
  Use AskUserQuestion: "Retry" / "Continue without UI verification"
  **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

**0-4. Test State Isolation** (all Features with persistent state):

> Prevents false positive/negative test results caused by state persisted from previous sessions (localStorage, electron-store, SQLite, config files, cookies, etc.).

**Skip if**: Feature has no persistent state (pure stateless API, library, CLI with no config).

Apply ONE of these strategies (in priority order):
1. **Clean user data directory**: Launch the app with an isolated/temporary user data path (e.g., `--user-data-dir=/tmp/verify-clean-{FID}` for Electron, fresh browser profile for web). This guarantees pristine default state
2. **Reset API**: If the app provides a config reset mechanism (IPC `config:reset`, API `POST /reset`, CLI `--factory-reset`), invoke it at verify start before any test execution
3. **State-aware test pattern**: If neither 1 nor 2 is possible, every test scenario MUST follow the **read-before-act** pattern:
   - Read current value first (`const before = await getCurrentTheme()`)
   - Set to the **opposite** of desired test value (ensure a real change happens)
   - Then set to desired value and verify the change
   - Never assume the starting state matches defaults

**Display**: `🧹 Test State Isolation: [strategy used] — [clean data dir | config reset | state-aware tests]`

**0-4b. Feature Reachability Gate** (GUI Features only):

> Prevents "Feature implemented but unreachable" — the Feature's UI exists but no navigation path leads to it from the home screen.

**Skip if**: Feature has no GUI interface, or Feature IS the home/shell Feature (F001-shell, F000-* bootstrap).

1. From the app's home screen (initial state after launch), attempt to navigate to the current Feature's primary screen using **only UI interactions** (click navigation items, menu entries, buttons, icons)
2. **Do NOT use direct URL navigation** (`page.goto('/settings')`) — users don't type URLs in desktop/mobile apps
3. Navigation path sources (check in order):
   a. `interaction-surfaces.md` — if exists, look for entry point mapping for this Feature
   b. `pre-context.md` → Source Reference or SBI — look for navigation hints (e.g., "gear icon in navbar")
   c. Common patterns: sidebar menu, top nav tabs, settings gear icon, user menu dropdown
4. **If reachable** → record navigation path: `✅ Reachable: Home → Sidebar → Settings icon → Settings page`
5. **If NOT reachable** within 3 attempts → **CRITICAL BLOCK**:
   ```
   🚫 Feature Reachability BLOCKED for [FID]:
     No UI path from home screen to [Feature] screen.
     The Feature exists but users cannot access it.
   ```
   → Regression to implement: add navigation entry point (icon, button, menu item) in the appropriate existing UI component

**0-5. Note**: After Phase 0 (including State Isolation and Reachability Gate), the app is running. Pre-flight MCP check (next) can now detect tools correctly.
If Pre-flight still fails → the CDP Endpoint Diagnostic (in the Pre-flight section below) provides specific guidance.

---

### Pre-flight: Runtime Verification Backend Detection

**Run this BEFORE Phase 1.** (After Phase 0 if applicable.) Determines which runtime verification backends are available for Phase 3.

> For the full backend registry, detection order, and interface mapping, see [reference/runtime-verification.md](../reference/runtime-verification.md).
> For the user cooperation pattern used in HARD STOPs below, see [reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md](../reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md).

**Step 1 — Determine active interface** (from sdd-state.md Domain Profile → Interfaces):
- If `gui` in interfaces → GUI detection path (Step 2a)
- If `http-api` in interfaces → API detection path (Step 2b)
- If `cli` in interfaces → CLI detection path (Step 2c)
- If `data-io` in interfaces → Data-IO detection path (Step 2d)
- Multiple interfaces → run ALL applicable detection paths

**Step 2a — GUI Backend Detection**:

Execute the full detection protocol defined in [runtime-verification.md §3a](../reference/runtime-verification.md):

1. **Probe Playwright CLI** (two-phase: binary + library import + recovery) → `PLAYWRIGHT_CLI = available / unavailable`
2. **Check VERIFY_STEPS test file** (`demos/verify/F00N-name.spec.ts`) → `VERIFY_TEST = exists / missing`
3. **Probe Playwright MCP** (optional) → `MCP_STATUS = active / configured / unavailable`

   > **MCP probe note**: "Target page, context or browser has been closed" = `configured`, NOT `unavailable`. MCP IS installed, CDP IS configured, but app is not running. Agent starts it in Phase 3 Step 3 (Case B).

4. **Classify RUNTIME_BACKEND** per [runtime-verification.md §3a table](../reference/runtime-verification.md):
   `cli` (best) → `cli-limited` → `mcp` → `demo-only` → `build-only` (worst).
   If demo script also doesn't exist → `build-only`.

**Step 2b — API Backend Detection**:
HTTP client (curl) is always available. Set `RUNTIME_BACKEND = http-client` for this interface. No HARD STOP needed.

**Step 2c — CLI Backend Detection**:
Shell is always available. Set `RUNTIME_BACKEND = process-runner` for this interface. No HARD STOP needed.

**Step 2d — Data-IO Backend Detection**:
Shell is always available. Set `RUNTIME_BACKEND = pipeline-runner` for this interface. No HARD STOP needed.

---

**⛔ Workaround Prohibition** (clarified scope — see [runtime-verification.md](../reference/runtime-verification.md) §5):
- **PROHIBITED**: Raw CDP WebSocket scripts, puppeteer, custom fetch-based CDP calls
- **PERMITTED**: Playwright CLI (`npx playwright test`), HTTP client (curl/supertest), process execution, standard shell commands — these are first-class verification backends, not workarounds

---

**HARD STOP conditions for GUI interface**:

**If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = cli` or `cli-limited` or `mcp`**: No HARD STOP. Display informational message:
- `cli`: `ℹ️ Runtime verification: Playwright CLI (standard path)`
- `cli-limited`: `ℹ️ Runtime verification: Playwright CLI (ad-hoc — no test file, will use inline exploration)`
- `mcp`: `ℹ️ Runtime verification: Playwright MCP (accelerator mode)`

**If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = demo-only`**: Display warning, no HARD STOP:
`⚠️ Neither Playwright MCP nor CLI available. Runtime verification limited to demo --ci.`

**If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = build-only`** — run CDP Diagnostic (Electron only), then HARD STOP:

**CDP Diagnostic** (Electron projects only — detected from constitution-seed.md or pre-context.md tech stack):
1. Run `curl -s http://localhost:9222/json/version` (timeout 3s)
2. **If curl succeeds** (returns JSON): CDP is active but Playwright tools are not loaded.
   - Diagnosis: `CDP endpoint is running at localhost:9222. Playwright MCP tools are not loaded in this session.`
   - Likely cause: Claude Code session was started before the app, or MCP is not configured with `--cdp-endpoint`. If Playwright CLI is available, this is not blocking — CLI backend can be used without MCP.
3. **If curl fails** (connection refused / timeout): CDP endpoint is not running.
   - Diagnosis: `CDP endpoint not running.`

**Non-Electron projects**: Skip CDP probe.

Display the diagnostic result (if applicable), then **HARD STOP**:
```
⚠️ No runtime verification backend available for GUI Features.

[If Electron + CDP diagnostic ran]:
  📋 CDP Diagnostic: [diagnosis from above]

How to enable runtime verification:
  Option 1 (Recommended): Install Playwright CLI
    npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install
  Option 2: Configure Playwright MCP (requires session restart to load MCP tools)
    claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest
    For Electron: claude mcp add playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --cdp-endpoint http://localhost:9222
```
**Use AskUserQuestion**:
- "Install Playwright CLI now" (Recommended) — run `npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install`, re-probe, set RUNTIME_BACKEND
- "Configure Playwright MCP" — requires session restart for MCP tools (see [runtime-verification.md §4](../reference/runtime-verification.md))
- "Continue without UI verification" — proceed, Phase 3 Step 3 runtime verification will use demo --ci only
**If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

**For non-GUI interfaces**: No HARD STOP. Display:
`ℹ️ Runtime verification: [backend name] for [interface type]`

**Record the detection result.** Phase 3 will use `RUNTIME_BACKEND` — do NOT re-detect or re-ask.

---

### Phase 1: Execution Verification (BLOCKING)

Run each check and record results. **If any check fails, verification is BLOCKED — do not proceed to Phase 2/3/4.**

1. **Test check**: Detect and execute the project's test command (from `sdd-state.md` → `## Toolchain` → Test row, or from `package.json` scripts, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, etc.). If `**Structure**: monorepo`, use workspace-aware test command (e.g., `turbo run test`, `bun run --filter=* test`).
2. **Build check**: Run the build command and confirm no errors. If `**Structure**: monorepo`, use workspace-aware build command.
3. **Lint check**: Detect and execute the lint tool per domain detection rules.

   **Step 3a — Check Toolchain state** (from Foundation Gate):
   Read `sdd-state.md` → `## Toolchain` section → Lint row Status:
   - `⚠️ not installed` → **skip lint entirely**. Display:
     `⏭️ Lint: skipped — tool not installed (detected in Foundation Gate). Install [command] to enable.`
     This is NOT a Phase 1 failure. Record lint result as `skipped (not installed)`.
   - `✅ available` → proceed to Step 3b (execute lint)
   - `ℹ️ not configured` → **skip**. Display: `ℹ️ Lint: not configured`. Record as `not configured`.
   - Toolchain section absent (legacy sdd-state.md or Foundation Gate not yet run) → fall through to Step 3b (detect on-the-fly for backward compatibility)

   **Step 3b — Execute lint** (when tool is available or status unknown):
   1. Detect the lint command per `domains/_core.md` § S3b (Lint Tool Detection Rules)
   2. Run the detected lint command
   3. **Distinguish failure types**:
      - **Tool not found** (exit code 127 / "command not found"): This is a **toolchain issue**, NOT a code quality issue.
        Display: `⚠️ Lint: tool not found ([command]). This is a toolchain issue, not a code problem.`
        **Offer auto-install** via AskUserQuestion:
        - "Install now" — run the install command from `domains/_core.md` § S3b (e.g., `npm install --save-dev eslint`). After install, re-run lint. If lint passes → record `✅ available` + `✅ Lint: passed`. If lint finds errors → record `✅ available` + report lint errors as normal Phase 1 failure.
        - "Skip — proceed without lint" — record `⚠️ not installed` in `sdd-state.md` Toolchain. Treat as skipped, do NOT block.
        **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1).
      - **Lint errors found** (exit code 1 with lint output): This is a **code quality issue**.
        Display: `❌ Lint: [N] errors found`
        This IS a Phase 1 failure — **BLOCKS** per normal rules.
      - **Lint passes** (exit code 0): Display: `✅ Lint: passed`

4. **i18n coverage check** (skip if project has no i18n / translation framework):

   Detect i18n framework: search for `i18next`, `react-intl`, `vue-i18n`, `@angular/localize`, `gettext` in config/package files. If none found → skip entirely.

   > Adapt file extensions and translation call patterns to the project's tech stack.

   **Step 4a — Collect used keys**: Grep source files (`src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,vue,svelte}`) for translation call patterns:
   - `t('key')`, `t("key")`, `$t('key')`, `i18n.t('key')`, `useTranslation` + `t('key')`
   - Extract the key strings into a deduplicated list

   **Step 4b — Collect defined keys**: For each locale JSON/YAML file (e.g., `en.json`, `ko.json`, `messages_en.properties`):
   - Extract all key paths (flattened dot-notation for nested JSON)

   **Step 4c — Cross-check**:
   | Check | Severity |
   |-------|----------|
   | Key used in code but missing in ANY locale file | ❌ ERROR — UI will show raw key string |
   | Key in locale A but missing in locale B | ⚠️ WARNING — incomplete translation |
   | Key defined but never used in code | ℹ️ INFO — dead key (not blocking) |

   **Display**:
   ```
   🌐 i18n Coverage:
     Keys used in code: [N]
     Locale files: [list e.g., en.json, ko.json]
     Missing keys (code → locale): [N] ❌
       [key1] — missing in: ko.json
       [key2] — missing in: en.json, ko.json
     Incomplete translations: [N] ⚠️
     Dead keys: [N] ℹ️
   ```

   **Blocking**: Missing keys (code references a key that exists in NO locale file) → Phase 1 FAILURE. Incomplete translations (key in one locale but not another) → ⚠️ WARNING (not blocking, but reported).

5. **Build output fidelity check** (all project types — scope varies):

   Build success does NOT guarantee runtime correctness. Many frameworks require build-time plugins that, when missing, cause **silent failures** — build passes, types check, app runs, but framework output is absent.

   **Step 5a — Build-time framework detection**: Scan project configuration for frameworks requiring build plugins:
   - **CSS frameworks**: Tailwind CSS (`@tailwindcss/vite`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`), PostCSS plugins, CSS Modules
   - **i18n extraction**: compile-time message extractors (`@formatjs/swc-plugin`, `babel-plugin-react-intl`)
   - **Code generation**: Prisma, GraphQL codegen, OpenAPI generators (check if `generate` scripts exist in `package.json`)
   - **Asset pipeline**: image optimizers, SVG sprite generators, font subsetters
   - No build-time frameworks detected → skip this check

   **Step 5b — Plugin registration verification** (for each detected framework):
   - Verify the framework's build plugin is registered in the correct build configuration
   - For multi-config builds (e.g., `electron.vite.config` with main/preload/renderer): verify the plugin is in the **correct target config** (e.g., CSS plugin in renderer, not main)
   - For codegen: verify generation scripts run before build (prebuild hook or explicit step)
   - If plugin/script is missing → ❌ **BLOCKING** — framework output will not be generated

   **Step 5c — Runtime output spot check** (if applicable and Playwright available for GUI):
   - **GUI/CSS**: Start the app, take a snapshot — check that styled container elements have non-default dimensions (not all at 0×0 or stacked linearly)
   - **i18n**: Verify at least one translated string appears in rendered output (not raw keys like `messages.welcome`)
   - **Codegen**: Verify generated types/clients exist and are importable
   - If output appears non-functional → ⚠️ WARNING — likely build plugin misconfiguration

   **Display**:
   ```
   🔧 Build Output Fidelity:
     Detected frameworks: [Tailwind CSS 4, i18n (formatjs) / none]
     Plugin registration: [✅ all registered / ❌ MISSING — {framework}: {expected plugin} not in {config}]
     Runtime check: [✅ output verified / ⚠️ output missing / skipped (not applicable)]
   ```

**If ANY check fails** (test, build, lint errors, missing i18n keys, or build plugin missing), display and STOP:
```
❌ Execution Verification failed for [FID] - [Feature Name]:
  Tests: [PASS/FAIL — pass count/total, failure details]
  Build: [PASS/FAIL — error summary]
  Lint:  [PASS/FAIL/skipped (not installed)/not configured]
  i18n:  [PASS/FAIL/skipped (no i18n) — missing key count]
  Build fidelity: [PASS/FAIL/skipped (no build-time frameworks detected)]

Fix the failing checks before verification can continue.
Verification is BLOCKED — merge will not be allowed until all checks pass.
⚠️ Source Modification Gate applies — before fixing ANY source file, run the Pre-Fix Classification gate.
```

**Use AskUserQuestion** with options:
- "Fix and re-verify" — user will fix, then re-run `/smart-sdd verify`
- "Show failure details" — display full test/build/lint output
- "Acknowledge limited verification" — proceed with ⚠️ limited-verify (requires reason)

**If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1). **Do NOT proceed to Phase 2** until all three checks pass **OR** the user explicitly acknowledges limited verification.

**Limited-verify exception path**: If the user selects "Acknowledge limited verification":
1. Ask for the reason (e.g., "Tests require external service not available", "Build depends on Feature B not yet merged", "DB migration requires completed Feature C")
2. Record in `sdd-state.md` Feature Detail Log → verify row Notes: `⚠️ LIMITED — [reason]`
3. Set the verify step icon to `⚠️` (not ✅) in Feature Progress
4. **Proceed to Phase 2 AND Phase 3 sequentially** — Phase 1 limited-acknowledge does NOT skip subsequent phases. All phases (2, 3, 4) MUST still execute. The merge step will display a reminder that this Feature has limited verification.
5. **This is NOT a skip** — the limitation is tracked and visible in status reports

> **Build prerequisites**: If the build fails due to missing setup steps (e.g., `pnpm approve-builds`, native module compilation), include the specific prerequisite command in the error message so the user knows what to run.

### Phase 2: Cross-Feature Consistency + Behavior Completeness Verification

**Step 1 — Cross-Feature consistency**:
- Check the cross-verification points in the "For /speckit.analyze" section of `pre-context.md`
- Analyze whether shared entities/APIs changed by this Feature affect other Features
- Verify that entity-registry.md and api-registry.md match the actual implementation

**Step 1a — Feature Contract Compliance Check** (skip if pre-context.md has no "Feature Contracts" section):

> Guard 6a: Provides Interface Verification. Each `Provides →` interface must be verified
> from the consumer's perspective — not just the provider's.
> See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 6.

1. **Guarantee verification**: For each Guarantee this Feature provides (C-[FID]-G## entries):
   - Grep the Feature's code for the interface/function/API described in the Guarantee
   - Verify the interface returns/provides what the Guarantee promises (type check, not runtime)
   - If not implemented → `⚠️ Contract C-[FID]-G## not implemented — [Consumer Feature] depends on this`

2. **Dependency status check**: For each Dependency this Feature requires (C-[FID]-D## entries):
   - Check if the Provider Feature has verify status = `success` or `limited` in sdd-state.md
   - If Provider NOT verified → `⚠️ Dependency C-[FID]-D## on [Provider Feature] — provider not yet verified`
   - If Provider verified → check that the specific interface still exists in Provider's code (cross-reference)

3. Report:
   Example:
   ```
   📋 Feature Contract Compliance for [FID]:
     Guarantees: [N]/[M] implemented
       ⚠️ C-F007-G01: getKnowledgeReferences() not returning name field (F005-chat depends on this)
     Dependencies: [N]/[M] providers verified
       ✅ C-F007-D01: F001-auth verified, middleware available
   ```

4. **Result**:
   - **Default**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking). Unimplemented Guarantees are strong indicators of downstream Feature failures and should be prioritized during Phase 3 runtime verification.
   - **BLOCKING escalation for rebuild mode**: When Origin=`rebuild` AND this Feature has `Provides →` interfaces (i.e., at least one C-[FID]-G## Guarantee), unimplemented Guarantees are **❌ BLOCKING**, not warnings. The agent MUST halt and report:
     ```
     🔴 BLOCKING: Contract C-[FID]-G## not implemented — rebuild mode requires all Guarantees to be fulfilled.
        [Consumer Feature] depends on this interface matching the source app's behavior.
        → Return to implement to complete the interface, or explicitly defer with user approval.
     ```
     **Rationale**: In rebuild mode, downstream Features depend on these interfaces matching the source app's behavior. An unimplemented Guarantee will cause the next Feature's implementation to diverge from the original app, propagating behavioral drift through the pipeline.
     (See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 6: Cross-Feature Interface Verification, § Guard 1: Guideline → Gate Escalation)

**Step 1b — Plan Deviation Quick Check**:
Lightweight sanity check to catch structural drift between plan artifacts and implementation:
1. **Entity count**: Count entities in `data-model.md` (or plan.md data model section) → compare to actual model/type/schema files. Flag if actual count differs by ±30% or more.
2. **API/IPC channel count**: Count endpoints/channels in `contracts/` → compare to actual route/handler definitions. Flag if mismatch.
3. **Tasks completion rate**: Read `tasks.md` checkbox states → report completion rate.
   - 100% complete → ✅ proceed
   - <100% AND sdd-state.md Notes contains `⚠️ DEFERRED:` for this Feature → ⚠️ warning (user already acknowledged during Completeness Gate)
   - <100% AND no DEFERRED acknowledgment → ❌ **BLOCKING**: `🔴 [N] tasks not completed and not deferred — implement Completeness Gate may have been skipped. Return to implement to complete remaining tasks or explicitly defer them.`
4. Report:
   ```
   📋 Plan Deviation Quick Check:
     Entities: plan [N] / actual [N] — ✅ match (or ⚠️ ±[N] drift)
     API channels: plan [N] / actual [N] — ✅ match (or ⚠️ ±[N] drift)
     Tasks: [N]/[total] complete ([%])
   ```
5. Any flag → ⚠️ warning (NOT blocking). Helps reviewer spot gaps before Phase 3.
6. **Skip if**: No data-model.md, no contracts/, or Feature has < 5 tasks (too small to drift)

**Step 1c — Data Dependency Verification** (cross-Feature runtime data):

> Addresses the case where a Feature depends on data from another Feature (e.g., AI model embeddings, shared database entries, cached state) and that data source is not available at verify time.
> Beyond structural type compatibility (Step 1/Step 6) — checks runtime data availability.

1. Read `pre-context.md` → "Functional Enablement Chain" → "Blocked by ←" entries. Identify each cross-Feature data dependency.
2. For each data dependency:
   a. **Structural check** (always — grep-based):
      - Verify the data source exists in code (store, API endpoint, database table/model)
      - Verify the data shape is compatible (per Step 6 Integration Contract verification)
   b. **Runtime data check** (when `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is not `build-only`):
      - Start app (reuse Phase 0 instance if running)
      - Navigate to the screen/endpoint that consumes the data:
        - For GUI: snapshot → check for data elements (list items, table rows, rendered content)
        - For API: curl endpoint → verify response body is not empty/default
        - For CLI: run command → verify output contains expected data
      - **Empty data = WARNING** (not blocking):
        `⚠️ Data dependency: [source Feature] → [this Feature] — runtime data is EMPTY. This may indicate [source Feature] model/service is not running or populated.`
   c. **External model/service check** (if dependency involves AI models, external services):
      - Probe the service endpoint (`curl` with timeout 5s)
      - If unreachable: `⚠️ External dependency [service name] not reachable. SCs depending on it will be classified as user-assisted or external-dep.`
3. Report:
   ```
   📊 Data Dependency Verification for [FID]:
     F001-auth → session store: (code) ✅ (runtime) ✅ data present
     F003-ai → embedding model: (code) ✅ (runtime) ❌ model not responding
       ⚠️ SCs requiring embeddings reclassified to user-assisted
   ```
4. **Result**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking) — prominently displayed in Review. Downstream impact: SCs whose data dependencies are unavailable are reclassified from auto categories to `user-assisted` or `external-dep` in the SC Verification Matrix.
5. **Skip if**: No "Blocked by ←" entries in pre-context.md, or Feature has no cross-Feature dependencies.

**Step 1d — Service Integration Verification** (import graph check):

> Catches "orphaned service" pattern: a service/module is implemented and tested in isolation but never imported by its runtime consumer. Phase 1 (test/build/lint) does not detect orphaned code — tests pass, build succeeds, lint is clean. This step verifies that new services are actually wired into the application.

1. **Scope**: Use `git diff --name-only main...HEAD` to identify files created/modified by this Feature. Filter to service/module files (exclude tests, types, configs):
   > The patterns below are for JS/TS projects. Adapt file extensions and naming conventions to the project's language.
   - Include: `*.service.ts`, `*.store.ts`, `*.composable.ts`, `*.hook.ts`, `*.provider.ts`, `*Service.ts`, `*Store.ts`, `*Repository.ts`, `*Manager.ts`, `*Helper.ts`, `*Util.ts`
   - Include any file that exports a class or function with `Service`, `Store`, `Repository`, `Manager`, `Provider` in the name
   - Exclude: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*.d.ts`, `*.config.*`, `*.mock.*`

2. **For each service/module file**, check import graph:
   Example (JS/TS):
   ```bash
   # Find all non-test files that import this module
   grep -r "import.*from.*[module-path]" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.vue" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" \
     | grep -v ".test." | grep -v ".spec." | grep -v "__tests__" | grep -v "__mocks__"
   ```
   - Count non-test consumers (files that import this module)

3. **Classification**:
   - **0 non-test consumers** → `⚠️ WARNING: Orphaned service — [ServiceName] has no runtime consumers`
   - **0 non-test consumers AND plan.md lists this service as consumed by a component/route** → `⚠️ HIGH WARNING: [ServiceName] is planned as runtime dependency of [Consumer] but has 0 imports — likely missing wire-up`
   - **≥1 non-test consumer** → ✅ Service is integrated

4. Report:
   ```
   📊 Service Integration Verification for [FID]:
     KnowledgeChatService: ⚠️ ORPHANED — 0 runtime imports (test-only: knowledge-chat.test.ts)
       → Plan.md: consumed by InputBar.tsx (knowledge base picker)
       → Suggested fix: import KnowledgeChatService in InputBar.tsx
     AssistantStore: ✅ 3 runtime consumers (ChatPanel.tsx, InputBar.tsx, SettingsPanel.tsx)
     ThemeService: ✅ 1 runtime consumer (App.tsx)
   ```
5. **Result**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking) — prominently displayed in Review. Orphaned services are strong indicators of incomplete implementation wiring.
6. **Skip if**: No new service/module files in Feature diff, or Feature is test-only/docs-only.

**Step 1e — Cross-Module API Contract Verification** (intra-Feature boundary check):

> Catches function name mismatches, argument format incompatibilities, and return type mismatches across module boundaries WITHIN the same Feature. Step 3 (Interaction Chain) checks handler names exist. Step 6 checks cross-Feature data shapes. Step 1d checks import existence. But NONE verify that the caller's arguments match the callee's parameters, or that the caller uses the correct function name.
>
> Common bugs caught: mismatched function names across module boundaries, incompatible argument shapes, missing platform API calls.

1. **Identify API boundaries** in the Feature's code (use `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`):
   - **IPC boundaries** (Electron/Tauri): `ipcRenderer.invoke('channel', args)` ↔ `ipcMain.handle('channel', (event, args) => ...)`
   - **Preload bridge** (Electron only): renderer calls via `window.api.method(args)` ↔ preload exposes `method: (args) => ipcRenderer.invoke(...)`
   - **Service layer**: component imports `ServiceName` and calls `service.method(args)` ↔ service defines `method(params)`
   - **External API**: service constructs URL and sends `fetch(url, {body})` ↔ API expects specific URL format and body schema

2. **For each boundary**, verify contract compatibility:
   ```
   Caller side:                          Callee side:
   ─────────────────────                  ─────────────────────
   Function name match?                   Function/method name exists?
   Argument count match?                  Parameter count matches?
   Argument types compatible?             Parameter types expected?
   Return value used correctly?           Return type documented/typed?
   ```

   **Verification method** (grep + AST-lite):
   - Grep caller file for the call expression → extract function name + argument pattern
   - Grep callee file for the function definition → extract parameter pattern
   - Compare:
     - Function name exact match (case-sensitive)
     - Argument count: caller passes N args, callee expects M params → if N ≠ M: `❌ Argument count mismatch`
     - Argument shape: if caller passes `{extensions: [...]}` but callee expects `(filters, multiple)` → `❌ Argument shape mismatch`

3. **Report**:
   Example (Electron + AI project):
   ```
   📊 Cross-Module API Contract Verification for [FID]:
     Renderer → Preload (window.api):
       selectFiles({extensions: ['.pdf']}) ↔ selectFiles(filters, multiple)
       ❌ Argument shape mismatch — caller passes object, callee expects positional args
     Preload → IPC Handler:
       invoke('kb:loadDocument', path) ↔ handle('kb:loadItem', (event, path))
       ❌ Channel name mismatch — 'kb:loadDocument' vs 'kb:loadItem'
     KBService → EmbeddingService:
       embed(text, model) ↔ embed(text, options)
       ⚠️ Second argument shape may differ (string vs object)
     EmbeddingService → External API:
       POST /embeddings ↔ API expects /v1/embeddings
       ❌ URL path mismatch
   ```

4. **Result classification**:
   - Function/channel name mismatch → `❌ HIGH WARNING` — will cause runtime TypeError or "no handler" error
   - Argument count/shape mismatch → `❌ HIGH WARNING` — will cause undefined parameters or wrong behavior
   - URL path mismatch → `⚠️ WARNING` — will cause 404 at runtime
   - All contracts match → `✅ API contracts verified`
5. **Result**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking) — prominently displayed in Review. Contract mismatches are strong indicators of integration bugs.
6. **Skip if**: Feature has no cross-module boundaries (single-file Feature, pure UI component, or utility library).

**Step 1f — Cross-Feature File Modification Audit** (Features with Integration Contracts):

> Step 1d checks "is the new service imported?" and Step 1e checks "do caller/callee interfaces match?" — but NEITHER checks "did this Feature modify the existing Feature files it was supposed to modify?" A Feature that `Consumes ← F005-chat-ui: Inputbar toolbar` should have modified Inputbar.tsx, but if it only created new files without touching the existing code, Steps 1d/1e both pass while the integration is actually missing.

1. **Read plan.md** `## Integration Contracts` → extract all `Consumes ←` entries. For each entry, identify the Target Feature and Interface.
2. **Map Interface to source files**: From the Interface column (e.g., `Inputbar toolbar`, `MessageContent renderer`, `AppRouter routes`), identify the likely source file(s) in the target Feature's directory.
3. **Check git diff**:
   ```bash
   git diff main...HEAD --name-only | grep -i "[target feature path or file pattern]"
   ```
4. **Classification**:
   - Integration Contract target file IS in diff → `✅ Cross-Feature file modified`
   - Integration Contract target file NOT in diff:
     - `⚠️ WARNING: [FID] consumes [Target Feature]/[Interface] per Integration Contracts, but no files in [Target Feature path] were modified. This suggests the integration wiring may be missing — new code was created but not connected to the existing application.`
5. **Report**:
   ```
   📊 Cross-Feature File Modification Audit for [FID]:
     Consumes ← F005-chat-ui / Inputbar toolbar:
       ⚠️ 0 files modified in pages/home/Inputbar/ — wiring likely missing
     Consumes ← F003-ai-core / ParameterBuilder:
       ✅ services/ParameterBuilder.ts modified (+12 lines)
   ```
6. **Result**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking) — prominently displayed in Review. Combined with Step 1d (orphan detection) and Step 1e (contract mismatch), this provides a three-layer integration verification: import exists (1d) + interface matches (1e) + target file actually modified (1f).
7. **Skip if**: No `## Integration Contracts` in plan.md, or no `Consumes ←` entries.

**Step 2 — Source Behavior Completeness** (only for brownfield rebuild — Origin: `rebuild`):
If `pre-context.md` contains a "Source Behavior Inventory" section, perform a per-Feature mini-parity check:

1. Read the Source Behavior Inventory table (function/method list with P1/P2/P3 priorities)
2. Read the Feature's `spec.md` FR-### list
3. For each P1/P2 behavior, check if a corresponding FR-### exists that covers the behavior
4. Display a coverage summary:
   ```
   📊 Source Behavior Coverage for [FID]:
     P1 behaviors: [covered]/[total] ([%])
     P2 behaviors: [covered]/[total] ([%])
     P3 behaviors: [covered]/[total] (informational)
     Uncovered P1: [list function names]
     Uncovered P2: [list function names]
   ```
5. **If any P1 behavior is uncovered**: Display a warning — `⚠️ [N] P1 source behaviors not covered by FR-###. These may represent missing functionality.`
   - This is a **warning, not a blocker** — the user may proceed but should consider whether the omission is intentional
   - **Migration-strategy-aware coverage** (read `migration_strategy` from sdd-state.md Rebuild Configuration):
     - `big-bang`: P1 coverage must be 100% across ALL Features before first merge. If any P1 is uncovered in ANY Feature, escalate to ⚠️ HIGH WARNING
     - `incremental` / `strangler-fig`: P1 coverage required for current Feature only. Cross-Feature P1 coverage tracked but not blocking per-Feature
6. If no Source Behavior Inventory exists (greenfield/add), skip this step

**Step 3 — Interaction Chain Completeness** (UI Features with Interaction Chains in plan.md):

If `plan.md` contains an `## Interaction Chains` section:

1. Parse each row: FR | User Action | **Handler** | **Store Mutation** | **DOM Effect** | Visual Result | Verify Method
2. For each chain, verify the key implementation steps exist in the Feature's code (use `git diff --name-only` to scope to changed files):
   - **Handler**: grep for the function name (e.g., `onThemeChange`, `handleFontSize`)
   - **Store Mutation**: grep for the store field assignment (e.g., `settings.theme`, `setTheme`, `theme =`)
   - **DOM Effect**: grep for the DOM manipulation (e.g., `classList.add`, `classList.toggle`, `style.fontSize`)
3. Report (tag each check `(code)` for grep-based, `(runtime)` for MCP/Playwright-verified):
   ```
   📊 Interaction Chain Completeness (code):
     FR-012 (theme toggle): Handler ✅ → Store ✅ → DOM ✅ — Full chain
     FR-015 (font size):    Handler ✅ → Store ✅ → DOM ❌ — Chain broken at DOM Effect
       ⚠️ Store mutation `settings.fontSize` found, but no corresponding `style.fontSize` assignment
   ```
4. **Async-flow rows**: If Interaction Chains contain `async-flow:` rows, additionally verify:
   - **Loading state**: grep for loading state management (e.g., `loading = true`, `setLoading`, `isLoading`)
   - **Error recovery**: grep for error handler + UI recovery (e.g., `catch`, `onError`, error state → enabled input)
   - **Cleanup**: grep for subscription/listener cleanup (e.g., `unsubscribe`, `abort`, `removeEventListener`, `cleanup`)
5. Broken chains → ⚠️ warning (NOT blocking) — but highlighted in Review as likely runtime failure
6. **Skip if**: No Interaction Chains section in plan.md, or Feature is backend-only

**Step 3b — UX Behavior Contract Verification** (UI Features with UX Behavior Contract in plan.md):

If `plan.md` contains a `## UX Behavior Contract` section:

1. Parse each row: Scenario | Expected Behavior | Failure Behavior | Verify Method
2. For each scenario, verify the implementation exists:
   - **Code check** (grep-based, no MCP needed):
     - Scroll behavior: grep for `scrollTop`, `scrollIntoView`, `scrollTo` in Feature's UI files
     - Loading states: grep for loading/spinner state management
     - Error recovery: grep for error state + input re-enable pattern
     - Cleanup on unmount: grep for lifecycle cleanup patterns appropriate to the framework (e.g., React `useEffect` return, Vue `onUnmounted`, Svelte `onDestroy`, Angular `ngOnDestroy`)
   - **Runtime check** (if MCP or Playwright CLI available):
     - Execute the Verify Method from the contract row (same verb syntax as Interaction Chains)
3. Report (each check tagged `(code)` or `(runtime)` to distinguish verification depth):
   ```
   📋 UX Behavior Contract Verification:
     Streaming auto-scroll:  (code) ✅ scrollIntoView found | (runtime) ✅ verify-scroll passed
     Loading state:          (code) ✅ isLoading state found | (runtime) ✅ wait-for .spinner passed
     Error recovery:         (code) ✅ error handler found   | (runtime) ⬜ requires API error — skip
     Cleanup on unmount:     (code) ❌ no cleanup in lifecycle hook
       ⚠️ Missing cleanup may cause memory leak or "state update on unmounted component" warning
   ```
4. Missing implementations → ⚠️ warning (NOT blocking) — but highlighted in Review
5. **Skip if**: No UX Behavior Contract in plan.md, or Feature is backend-only / sync-only UI

**Step 4 — Enablement Interface Smoke Test** (if Functional Enablement Chain exists):

> Guard 6b: Interaction Surface Inventory. Playwright checks each interaction surface
> from the inventory still works after this Feature's implementation.
> See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 6.

If `pre-context.md` contains a "Functional Enablement Chain" section with "Enables →" entries:

> This Feature provides runtime interfaces that downstream Features depend on.
> Verify these interfaces actually work BEFORE downstream Features are built.

1. Parse "Enables →" rows: Target Feature | Functional Dependency | Failure Impact
2. For each enablement interface:
   a. **Code existence check** (always — no MCP needed):
      - Grep for the interface (function, component, API endpoint) in the Feature's code
      - If not found → ❌ "Enablement interface not implemented"
   b. **Runtime smoke test** (if MCP or Playwright CLI available):
      - Navigate to the relevant screen and verify the interface element is visible/interactive
      - For API endpoints: `curl` the endpoint and verify non-error response
3. Report (each check tagged `(code)` or `(runtime)` to distinguish verification depth):
   ```
   🔗 Enablement Interface Smoke Test:
     Enables → F005-chat: Provider settings panel
       (code) ✅ SettingsPanel component exists
       (runtime) ✅ /settings renders, provider dropdown visible
     Enables → F006-export: Export API endpoint
       (code) ✅ /api/export handler exists
       (runtime) ✅ curl /api/export → 200 OK
   ```
4. **Failed enablement** → ⚠️ **HIGH warning** — downstream Features will likely fail
   Display: `⚠️ Enablement interface for [target] not working — [target Feature] will be blocked at runtime`
5. **Skip if**: No "Enables →" entries in Functional Enablement Chain

**Also check "Blocked by ←" entries** (this Feature's prerequisites):
1. For each "Blocked by ←" row, check if the source Feature has verify status = `success` in sdd-state.md
2. If source Feature is NOT verified: display warning:
   `⚠️ Blocked by F00N-[feature] which has NOT passed verify yet. This Feature's runtime may be affected.`
3. If source Feature IS verified AND app is running: run source Feature's demo in `--ci` mode to confirm it still works
   - If demo fails → ⚠️ warning: `Source Feature F00N-[feature] demo --ci failed — may affect this Feature`

**Step 5 — API Compatibility Matrix Verification** (if plan.md has API Compatibility Matrix):

If `plan.md` contains an `## API Compatibility Matrix` section with 2+ providers:

1. For each provider row in the matrix, verify the implementation handles provider-specific details:
   - **Auth method**: grep for each provider's auth pattern (e.g., `Bearer`, `x-api-key`, `anthropic-version`)
   - **Endpoint URLs**: grep for each provider's base URL or endpoint paths
   - **Response parsing**: grep for each provider's response format (e.g., `choices[0].message`, `content[0].text`)
2. Report:
   ```
   📊 API Compatibility Matrix Verification:
     OpenAI:    Auth ✅ (Bearer found) | Endpoint ✅ | Response ✅
     Anthropic: Auth ✅ (x-api-key found) | Endpoint ✅ | Response ❌ — using OpenAI response format
       ⚠️ Response parsing uses choices[0].message but Anthropic returns content[0].text
     Ollama:    Auth ✅ (no-auth) | Endpoint ✅ | Response ✅
   ```
3. Provider-specific mismatch → ⚠️ **HIGH warning** — will cause runtime auth/parsing failures
4. **Skip if**: No API Compatibility Matrix in plan.md, or < 2 providers

**Step 6 — Integration Contract Data Shape Verification** (if plan.md has Integration Contracts):

> **Skip if**: No `## Integration Contracts` section in plan.md, or no Functional Enablement Chain entries.

Verifies that the data shape contracts defined in plan.md are actually implemented with compatible types and that required bridges exist.

1. Read `SPEC_PATH/[NNN-feature]/plan.md` → `## Integration Contracts` section
2. For each row in the contracts table:
   a. **Interface existence check**: Grep for the Interface (function/API/store method) in the Feature's code
      - If not found → ❌ "Integration interface not implemented"
   b. **Shape compatibility check**: Read the actual type/interface definition from source code
      - Compare the implemented return type/parameter type against the documented Provider/Consumer Shape
      - Check field names, nesting structure, and type compatibility
      - If shapes are structurally incompatible → ❌ "Shape mismatch"
   c. **Bridge implementation check** (if Bridge column specifies an adapter/transform):
      - Grep for the bridge function/adapter in the Feature's code
      - If Bridge is specified but code not found → ❌ "Bridge adapter NOT FOUND"
      - If Bridge is `—` (shapes directly compatible): skip bridge check
3. Report (each check tagged `(code)` or `(runtime)` to distinguish verification depth):
   ```
   🔗 Integration Contract Verification:
     Provides → F005-chat: getActiveTools()
       (code) Interface: ✅ found in src/stores/mcp-store.ts
       (code) Shape: ✅ returns Tool[] matching consumer expectation
     Consumes ← F003-chat-core: ParameterBuilder.build(assistant)
       (code) Interface: ✅ found in src/services/parameter-builder.ts
       (code) Consumer expects: {mcpMode, mcpServers}
       (code) Bridge: ❌ mapMCPStoreToAssistant() NOT FOUND
       ⚠️ No adapter transforms useMCPStore state → assistant.mcpServers format
   ```
4. **Result classification**:
   - Missing interface → ⚠️ **HIGH warning** (enablement interface not implemented)
   - Shape mismatch → ⚠️ **HIGH warning** (will cause runtime TypeError or undefined access)
   - Missing bridge → ⚠️ **HIGH warning** (data will not flow between Features)
   - All checks pass → ✅ Integration contracts verified
5. **If Integration Contracts section missing in plan.md** but Feature has Enablement Chain:
   Display: `⚠️ Integration Contracts not defined in plan.md — cross-Feature data shape compatibility not verified. Consider running /smart-sdd plan [FID] to add contracts.`

### Phase 3: Demo-Ready Verification (BLOCKING — only if Demo-Ready Delivery is active)

> Guard 2: Static ≠ Runtime — Level 3. Interactions produce correct state (functional
> verification via Playwright). Static checks + smoke launch are insufficient — Playwright
> SC verification confirms runtime behavior matches specification.
> See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 2.

> **Interface conditional**: Phase 3 UI verification only executes when `gui` is in the active Interfaces (from sdd-state.md Domain Profile).
> For pure API/CLI/data-io projects, skip Phase 3 entirely and proceed to Phase 3b.

> **Demo-Ready Delivery is active** when: VI. Demo-Ready Delivery is in the constitution, OR `demos/` directory already contains Feature demo scripts from previous pipeline runs.
> **If Demo-Ready Delivery is NOT active**: Skip this phase entirely.
> Demo standards referenced in this phase are defined in [reference/demo-standard.md](../reference/demo-standard.md).
> **quickstart.md reference**: If `specs/{NNN-feature}/quickstart.md` exists, use it as the authoritative source for how the Feature should be launched and verified. The demo script must follow quickstart.md's run instructions.

**⚠️ Phase 3 has 10 mandatory steps + Phase 3b. Do NOT skip any step or jump directly to demo execution.**

> **🚫 GUI MANDATORY PLAYWRIGHT GATE** (enforced at Phase 3 entry):
> When `gui` is in the active Interfaces AND `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is not `build-only`:
> 1. **Playwright runtime verification CANNOT be skipped.** Static checks (build, tsc, lint) alone are NEVER sufficient for GUI Features. Playwright SC verification is equal in priority to build/lint/tsc — not optional.
> 2. **If Playwright is not installed**: Attempt installation (`npx playwright install chromium`). If installation fails, display HARD STOP with failure reason and ask user for resolution — do NOT silently skip.
> 3. **SC Verification Matrix MUST be displayed** before any Step 3+ execution begins. If the `cdp-auto` SC list is empty for a GUI Feature, the agent MUST explain why no SCs are automatable — an empty list without explanation is a verification failure.
> 4. **Post-gate announcement** (display after gate passes):
>    `🔒 Playwright Gate: PASSED — [N] cdp-auto SCs will be verified via Playwright [CLI|MCP]`
>    If Playwright unavailable after install attempt: `🔒 Playwright Gate: BLOCKED — [reason]. HARD STOP required.`
> 5. **Demo `--ci` ≠ UI Verification**: Running the demo script in CI mode (`--ci`) tests health/build/startup but does NOT verify UI element rendering or interaction. For GUI Features, Steps 3/3d (Playwright SC verification) are MANDATORY and cannot be replaced by demo `--ci` alone. If Steps 3/3d were skipped or produced no results, GUI verification is incomplete — this must be flagged in Review.

```
Phase 3 Checklist (must complete ALL in order):
  □ Step 0: SC Verification Planning (classify ALL SCs from spec.md — extended categories)
  □ Step 1: Demo script exists and is executable
  □ Step 2: Demo launches the real Feature
  □ Step 3: UI Verification via Playwright (CLI = standard, MCP = accelerator)  ← MANDATORY, not optional
  □ Step 3b: Visual Fidelity Check (rebuild mode only)
  □ Step 3c: Navigation Transition Sanity Check (GUI only)
  □ Step 3d: Interactive Runtime Verification (all interfaces — core runtime check)
  □ Step 3d2: Interaction Chain Verify Method Execution (GUI + plan.md chains)
  □ Step 3d3: Demo TEST PLAN Execution (when TEST PLAN block exists in demo script)
  □ Step 3e: Source App Comparative Verification (rebuild mode only)
  □ Step 3f: User-Assisted SC Completion Gate (user-assisted SCs — MANDATORY)
  □ Step 3f2: User-Assisted Manual Verification (manual SCs + manual TEST PLAN items)
  □ Step 4: Coverage mapping and demo components
  □ Step 5: CI/Interactive path convergence
  □ Step 6: Execute demo --ci
  □ Step 6b: Execute VERIFY_STEPS (functional verification)
  □ Phase 3b: Bug Prevention Verification (includes Empty State ≠ PASS + Dual-Mode Verification)
```

**Step 0 — SC Verification Planning** (classify ALL SCs — not just those in demo Coverage header):

Phase 3 Steps 3/6b currently only verify SCs mapped in the demo script's Coverage header. If coverage is low, most SCs get no runtime verification. This step ensures ALL SCs are classified and tracked.

1. Read `SPEC_PATH/[NNN-feature]/spec.md` → extract ALL SC-### items
2. For each SC, classify the verification method:

| Category | Criteria | Where Verified |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| `cdp-auto` | UI interaction with no external dependency (GUI Features) | Step 3/3d — Playwright MCP or CLI |
| `api-auto` | API endpoint test with no external dependency (http-api Features) | Step 3d — HTTP client |
| `cli-auto` | CLI command test with no external dependency (cli Features) | Step 3d — Process runner |
| `pipeline-auto` | Pipeline test with sample data (data-io Features) | Step 3d — Pipeline runner |
| `test-covered` | Behavior already verified by unit/integration tests in Phase 1 | Reference passing test name |
| `user-assisted` | Automatable AFTER user provides a dependency (API key, local service, config) | Step 3d — after user cooperation (see [user-cooperation-protocol.md](../reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md) §3) |
| `external-dep` | Truly inaccessible — production-only API, specific hardware, rate-limited service | Skip with explicit reason |
| `os-native` | OS-level interaction that Playwright cannot simulate (drag&drop files, system dialogs, clipboard, tray menu, keyboard shortcuts conflicting with OS) | Step 3f — user performs action, reports result |
| `manual` | Requires visual/subjective judgment that automation cannot evaluate | User-assisted manual verification in Step 3f2 |

   > **`user-assisted` vs `external-dep`**: If the user CAN provide the dependency locally (API key in .env, start a local service, test credentials), classify as `user-assisted`. If truly inaccessible (production-only, hardware, rate-limited quota), classify as `external-dep`. See [user-cooperation-protocol.md](../reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md) §3.

   > **SC Decomposition Rule**: When a single SC contains BOTH auto-verifiable steps AND user-dependent steps, SPLIT into sub-SCs at classification time:
   > - `SC-NNNa` (auto category): The portion that can be verified without external dependencies (UI interaction, state mutation, local data)
   > - `SC-NNNb` (`user-assisted`): The portion that requires user-provided dependency (API key, external service)
   >
   > **When to split**: SC description contains a multi-step flow where early steps are local (no external dependency) but later steps require an external service.
   > **When NOT to split**: The external dependency is needed from the first step (e.g., "login via OAuth" — cannot start without OAuth provider).
   >
   > Example: SC-007 "Knowledge base search integrates into chat with citations"
   > → SC-007a (`cdp-auto`): KB button click → picker opens → select KB → `assistant.knowledge_bases` updated in store
   > → SC-007b (`user-assisted`): Chat with KB attached → RAG injection → citation block rendered (requires API key)
   >
   > Sub-SCs appear as separate rows in the SC Verification Matrix and are verified independently: SC-007a in Step 3/3d (auto), SC-007b in Step 3d (after user cooperation) + Step 3f gate.

3. **Verification boundary** — what each runtime backend can automate (see [runtime-verification.md](../reference/runtime-verification.md) §6 for full protocols):

   **GUI (Playwright MCP/CLI)**:
   - ✅ CAN: Navigate pages, click buttons/links, fill forms, select options
   - ✅ CAN: Check element visibility, text content, attributes, CSS classes
   - ✅ CAN: Read console logs, detect JS errors, take screenshots
   - ✅ CAN: Interact with local/built-in functionality (in-memory data, local storage, static UI)
   - ⚠️ LIMITED: IPC calls (Electron main process) — verify indirectly via UI state changes after action
   - ❌ CANNOT: Provide API keys or authentication credentials
   - ❌ CANNOT: Start external server processes or connect to remote services
   - ❌ CANNOT: Evaluate subjective quality (design aesthetics, UX feel)

   **HTTP-API (curl/supertest)**:
   - ✅ CAN: Send requests, verify status codes, check response body shape
   - ✅ CAN: Test mutation side effects (POST then GET to verify)
   - ✅ CAN: Test auth-protected endpoints (401 without auth, 200 with)
   - ❌ CANNOT: Provide API keys or credentials for external services

   **CLI (process runner)**:
   - ✅ CAN: Execute commands, capture stdout/stderr/exit code
   - ✅ CAN: Test error handling (invalid args → non-zero exit + helpful message)

   **Data-IO (pipeline runner)**:
   - ✅ CAN: Run pipeline with test data, compare output schema and values
   - ✅ CAN: Verify no error logs during execution

4. Write the SC Verification Matrix (sub-SCs from Decomposition Rule appear as separate rows).
   **This matrix MUST be displayed in the verify output.** Do NOT proceed to Step 1+ without showing this matrix.
   ```
   SC Verification Matrix for [FID]:
   | SC | Category | Planned Method | Skip Reason |
   |----|----------|---------------|-------------|
   | SC-022 | cdp-auto | Navigate settings → add server → verify status | — |
   | SC-023a | cdp-auto | Navigate settings → open tool panel → verify tool list renders | — |
   | SC-023b | user-assisted | Execute tool → verify response | Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in .env |
   | SC-024 | cdp-auto | Enable built-in server → verify tool list loads | — |
   | SC-028 | api-auto | GET /api/config → verify 200 + response shape | — |
   | SC-031 | external-dep | — | Requires production MCP server (not locally available) |
   ```

   > **GUI Feature empty-list guard**: If `gui` is an active interface but the matrix contains ZERO `cdp-auto` rows, the agent MUST explain why no SCs are automatable via Playwright. A GUI Feature with no `cdp-auto` SCs is almost always a classification error — re-examine each SC for UI-automatable portions before concluding the list is genuinely empty.

5. **SC Minimum Depth Rule**: After classification, check each auto-category SC (`cdp-auto`, `api-auto`, `cli-auto`, `pipeline-auto`) for verification depth and assign a **Required Depth**:
   - Tier 1 (Presence): Element/response exists — `verify .settings-panel visible`
   - Tier 2 (State Change): Interaction produces expected state — `click toggle → verify-state .theme "dark"`
   - Tier 3 (Side Effect): State change propagates downstream — `verify-effect body class "dark-mode"`

   **Depth Assignment Rules**:
   - **Pure presence SC** (description uses "should be visible", "should exist", "should show", "should render"): Required Depth = Tier 1. Tier 1 is sufficient.
   - **Behavioral SC** (description uses "should change", "should update", "should display after", "should respond with", "should save", "should select", "should toggle", "should open", "should close"): Required Depth = **Tier 2 MANDATORY**. Agent MUST plan verification that includes a state change, not just presence.
   - **Flow SC** (description implies multi-step flow with downstream effects, e.g., "should update and reflect in..."): Required Depth = Tier 3 recommended, Tier 2 minimum.

   If an SC's planned verification is ONLY Tier 1 (presence) but Required Depth is Tier 2: `⚠️ SC-### verification is presence-only but SC requires behavioral verification — upgrading to Tier 2`. Agent MUST auto-upgrade to Tier 2. Record the Required Depth in the SC Verification Matrix for enforcement in Step 3d.

6. **Semantic Correctness Sanity Check** (data pipeline / external integration Features):
   For SCs that reference data processing correctness (embedding, search, extraction, ML inference), build/type/smoke success does NOT prove functional correctness. Add sanity checks to the SC Verification Matrix:

   | SC Pattern | Sanity Check Method | Failure Indicates |
   |-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
   | "search...and receive relevant results" | Insert known document, search for its content → result must contain that document | Search is stub/random |
   | "generate embeddings" | Same input twice → same vector output (deterministic) AND vector ≠ all zeros | Embedding is Math.random() |
   | "extract facts/memories" | Input "I prefer dark mode" → output must contain "dark" or "prefer" or "mode" | Extraction is keyword-only stub |
   | "via [provider] API" / "using LLM" | Actual network/IPC call must occur (check logs/network) → no call = stub | External call bypassed |

   **Enforcement**: If any sanity check fails → classify as `🚫 Semantic Stub` in SC Verification Matrix. This is BLOCKING — the Feature's core functionality is not actually working, regardless of build/type pass.

   ```
   SC Verification Matrix (sanity checks):
   | SC | Sanity Check | Result |
   |----|-------------|--------|
   | SC-001 | KB embed → deterministic vector | 🚫 FAIL: Math.random() detected |
   | SC-002 | Search known doc → relevant result | 🚫 FAIL: returns by recency, not relevance |
   ```

   > **Rationale (SKF-061)**: `Math.random()` embeddings, keyword-only extraction, and sort-by-date "search" all pass build, type, smoke, and even state-transition SCs (status goes pending→completed). Only semantic sanity checks catch the difference between "code that runs" and "code that works."

   **Code-Level Cross-Reference Rule** (applies when runtime verification is unavailable and code-level grep is the fallback):
   Verifying "function X exists" (Tier 1) is insufficient for behavioral SCs. When verifying "A changes B" at code level:
   - Identify A's **action target** (what DOM element / data store / file does it operate on?)
   - Identify B's **actual source** (where does the initial state come from?)
   - Confirm A's target and B's source reference the **same entity** (same selector, same variable, same file path)
   - If they reference different entities → flag as `⚠️ SC-### target mismatch: A operates on [X] but B reads from [Y]`
   - Example: a toggle function modifies `documentElement.classList` but CSS variables are scoped to `body.dark` → mismatch

   Add `Required Depth` column to SC Verification Matrix:
   ```
   | SC | Category | Planned Method | Required Depth | Skip Reason |
   |----|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
   | SC-022 | cdp-auto | Navigate settings → add server → verify status | Tier 2 | — |
   | SC-023a | cdp-auto | Navigate settings → open tool panel → verify list | Tier 2 | — |
   | SC-024 | cdp-auto | Enable built-in server → verify tool list loads | Tier 1 | — |
   | SC-025 | os-native | Drag file to KB area → status pending | Tier 2 | Synthetic DragEvent cannot carry real File paths |
   ```

7. **Manual Verification Fallback Protocol** (🚨 자동화 불가 = 사용자에게 위임, 건너뛰기 아님):

   에이전트의 도구 한계가 곧 검증의 한계가 아니다. 자동화할 수 없는 것을 사용자는 할 수 있다.

   **자동화 불가능한 검증을 만나면** (OS-native, 외부 API 키, 하드웨어, 주관적 판단):
   1. **포기하거나 "skip" 하지 않는다**
   2. AskUserQuestion으로 수동 확인 요청:
      ```
      ⚠️ 자동 테스트 불가: [기능명]
      이유: [Playwright synthetic DragEvent / API key 필요 / ...]

      직접 확인해주세요:
        동작: [파일을 KB 영역에 드래그앤드롭]
        기대 결과: [파일이 추가되고 상태가 pending → processing으로 전이]
        실패 시: [파일이 추가되지 않거나 에러 표시]
      ```
   3. 사용자 응답을 SC Verification Matrix에 기록:
      - "확인됨" → `✅ user-verified`
      - "실패함" → `❌ user-reported-failure` (bug fix severity 적용)
      - "확인 불가" → `⚠️ unverified: [reason]`

   ```
   ❌ WRONG: "Playwright 한계로 드래그앤드롭 skip" → 사용자도 모르게 미검증
   ❌ WRONG: "external-dep로 분류 → skip" → 사용자가 설정하면 테스트 가능한데 안 물어봄
   ✅ RIGHT: "자동 테스트 불가 → 사용자에게 구체적 확인 요청 → 결과 기록"
   ```

   | 기능 유형 | 자동화 가능? | 올바른 분류 |
   |----------|------------|-----------|
   | 파일 드래그앤드롭 | ❌ (synthetic event 한계) | `os-native` → 사용자 확인 |
   | 시스템 트레이 메뉴 | ❌ (OS-level) | `os-native` → 사용자 확인 |
   | API 키 필요 기능 | ⚠️ (사용자가 .env 설정하면 가능) | `user-assisted` → 사용자에게 설정 요청 후 자동 테스트 |
   | 파일 다이얼로그 | ❌ (OS native dialog) | `os-native` → 사용자 확인 |
   | 키보드 단축키 (OS 충돌) | ❌ (OS 단축키와 충돌 가능) | `os-native` → 사용자 확인 |

8. **Test Environment Alignment**:

   에이전트의 자동 테스트 환경과 사용자 환경이 최대한 동일해야 한다:
   - **dev 모드 프로젝트**: `pnpm run dev` (또는 해당 dev 명령)으로 앱 실행 후 Playwright 연결. 프로덕션 빌드(`out/main/index.js`)만 테스트하면 dev 모드 전용 문제를 놓침.
   - **Electron 프로젝트**: `_electron.launch()` 시 dev 서버가 실행 중이면 dev 서버에 연결, 아니면 빌드 결과물 사용.
   - **synthetic event 한계 명시**: Playwright의 synthetic event(`DragEvent`, `ClipboardEvent`)는 실제 OS 이벤트와 다름. `DataTransfer.files`에 실제 파일 경로가 포함되지 않는 등. 이런 SC는 `os-native`로 분류.

6. **Coverage assessment**:
   - Auto-verifiable (`cdp-auto` + `api-auto` + `cli-auto` + `pipeline-auto`): [N] SCs → will be verified in Step 3/3d
   - User-assisted: [N] SCs → will be verified in Step 3d after user cooperation (gate enforced in Step 3f)
   - Test-covered: [N] SCs → already verified in Phase 1
   - External-dep: [N] SCs → skipped with explicit reason
   - Manual: [N] SCs → skipped
   - **Effective coverage**: (auto + user-assisted + test-covered) / total = [N]%
   - If effective coverage < 50%: display `⚠️ SC verification coverage is [N]% — most SCs cannot be automatically verified for this Feature`

7. **Auto-category SCs drive Step 3/3d/3f**: In Step 3 SC-level UI verification, verify ALL `cdp-auto` SCs — not just those in the demo Coverage header. In Step 3d Interactive Runtime Verification, verify ALL interface-appropriate auto SCs (`api-auto`, `cli-auto`, `pipeline-auto`) plus `user-assisted` SCs (after cooperation). **Step 3f is a mandatory gate** that blocks progression to Step 4 until all `user-assisted` SCs are resolved (verified or explicitly skipped by user via AskUserQuestion).

**Step 1 — Check demo script exists AND is a real demo (NOT markdown, NOT test-only)**:
- Verify `demos/F00N-name.sh` (or `.ts`/`.py`/etc. matching the project's language) exists
- **REJECT if**: the file is `.md`, contains `## Demo Steps`, or consists of prose instructions instead of executable commands
- **REJECT if**: the file lacks a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` or equivalent) for `.sh` files
- **REJECT if**: the script only runs test assertions and exits (that's a test suite, not a demo) — a demo must launch the real Feature for the user to experience

- If a markdown demo file or test-only script was generated instead, **delete it** and create a proper demo script

**Step 2 — Check the demo launches the real Feature**:
- The demo script's default behavior must **start the Feature** and keep it running for the user to interact with
- The script must print concrete "Try it" instructions: real URLs to open, real curl commands to run, real CLI invocations to try (at least 2)
- The `--ci` flag must be supported for automated verification: runs setup + health check, then exits cleanly
- **REJECT if**: the script has no interactive experience (i.e., only runs assertions and exits with no live Feature)

**Step 3 — UI Verification via Playwright** (MANDATORY — do NOT skip):
> **App Session Management**: The agent manages the entire app lifecycle — start, verify, shut down. Do NOT ask the user to start or restart the app manually. The agent starts the app itself (with CDP flags for Electron), runs all SC verifications, then shuts down the app when done.

- **Runtime Degradation Flag Check**: Read sdd-state.md Feature Progress for this Feature. If Detail column shows `⚠️ RUNTIME-DEGRADED`:
  - Display: `⚠️ This Feature was implemented without runtime verification. Runtime bugs (selector instability, layout timing, infinite re-renders) may exist undetected.`
  - If `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is now `mcp`, `cli`, or `cli-limited`: proceed with full UI verification (this is the **recovery path** — extra scrutiny)
  - If `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is STILL `build-only`: **BLOCKING HARD STOP** — this Feature has NEVER had any runtime verification. Use AskUserQuestion:
    - "Install Playwright CLI and retry verify"
    - "Acknowledge NO runtime verification" — requires reason via "Other" input. Sets verify to `limited` status with `⚠️ NEVER-RUNTIME-VERIFIED — [reason]`
  - **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

- **Runtime Backend Check**: Use the `RUNTIME_BACKEND` from the Pre-flight detection (run before Phase 1).
  - If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = build-only` AND user chose "Continue without UI verification": skip to Step 4. Display: `⏭️ UI verification skipped (no runtime backend available — acknowledged in Pre-flight)`
  - If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = demo-only`: skip to Step 6 (demo --ci only). Display: `⏭️ Interactive UI verification skipped — using demo --ci for runtime check.`
  - If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = cli` or `cli-limited`:
    - **Playwright CLI verification (standard path)**: If `demos/verify/F00N-name.spec.ts` exists, run SC verification via CLI:
      1. Ensure app is running (from demo `--ci` or start it)
      2. For Electron: use `_electron.launch()` in test files (no CDP needed)
      3. Run: `npx playwright test demos/verify/F00N-name.spec.ts --reporter=json`
      4. Map test results back to SC-### coverage (Tier 1/2/3 results reported normally)
      5. Display: `ℹ️ SC verification via Playwright CLI (standard path)`
    - If no test file exists and `RUNTIME_BACKEND = cli-limited`: **ad-hoc runtime exploration** — cli-limited means Playwright CLI is available but no pre-written test file exists. This is NOT "no runtime access." The agent performs inline SC verification:
      1. Launch the app programmatically (Electron: `_electron.launch()`, Web: start dev server)
      2. Take a baseline snapshot — confirm main UI renders (not blank/crash)
      3. For each auto-category SC in the SC Verification Matrix, execute the planned verification inline (navigate, click, verify state change) using Playwright API calls
      4. Respect the SC Minimum Depth Rule — behavioral SCs require Tier 2 (state change), not just Tier 1 (presence)
      5. Shut down the app after all SCs are checked
      6. Display results in the same SC-### matrix format as the standard path
      7. If ad-hoc exploration is not feasible (e.g., app requires external services to render): fall back to demo --ci only, with explicit note of which SCs could not be runtime-verified
  - If `RUNTIME_BACKEND = mcp` → **MCP accelerator path**: proceed with Electron CDP check below (if Electron) or directly to SC verification (if web). MCP enables interactive, step-by-step verification without pre-written test files.
  - **If Pre-flight was somehow skipped**: Call `browser_snapshot` NOW. If the tool does not exist, run `npx playwright --version` as fallback. If neither exists, display the HARD STOP from Pre-flight and wait for user response. **Do NOT silently skip.**

- **Electron CDP Configuration Check** (MCP backend only — if project type is Electron AND `RUNTIME_BACKEND = mcp`):
  When using Playwright MCP as the backend, Electron apps require CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) for Playwright to connect. Standard Playwright MCP opens a separate Chromium browser and cannot interact with the Electron window.
  > **Note**: This check is SKIPPED when `RUNTIME_BACKEND = cli` or `cli-limited`. CLI mode uses `_electron.launch()` which connects directly to the Electron process without CDP.

  1. **Probe**: Call `browser_snapshot` to check current Playwright MCP configuration. There are FOUR possible outcomes:

     | Probe result | Meaning | Action |
     |---|---|---|
     | Snapshot shows Electron app content | CDP active + app already running | → Proceed directly to SC-level UI verification |
     | Snapshot shows a default new tab / Chrome start page | Standard mode (no `--cdp-endpoint` configured) | → **Case A**: CDP not configured — HARD STOP |
     | Tool call fails with ECONNREFUSED / connection refused | CDP IS configured but app is NOT running on the CDP port | → **Case B**: CDP configured — agent will start the app |
     | Tool call fails with "Target page, context or browser has been closed" or similar runtime error | CDP IS configured, was connected, but target is lost (app crashed/closed) | → **Case B**: Same as above — agent will (re)start the app |

     **CRITICAL**: Do NOT confuse Case B with "standard mode." When Playwright MCP has `--cdp-endpoint` configured but nothing is listening on that port, `browser_snapshot` will fail with a connection error (`ECONNREFUSED`) or "Target closed" error. This means CDP IS set up correctly — the app just needs to be started. **Do NOT use raw CDP/WebSocket scripts as a workaround — follow the Case B protocol.**

  2. **Case A — CDP not configured (standard mode detected)**: This is a **MANDATORY HARD STOP**.
     This is the ONLY case that requires user action — the user must reconfigure Playwright MCP itself.
     Display notice:
     ```
     ⚠️ Electron apps require CDP mode for Playwright MCP to connect.
        Playwright MCP is currently in standard browser mode.

        CDP setup (MCP mode):
        1. claude mcp remove playwright -s user
        2. claude mcp add --scope user playwright -- npx @playwright/mcp@latest --cdp-endpoint http://localhost:9222
        3. Restart Claude Code (ONLY required for MCP — if Playwright CLI is available, consider switching to CLI backend instead)

        Alternative — switch to CLI backend (no restart needed):
        npm install -D @playwright/test && npx playwright install
        CLI uses _electron.launch() and does not need CDP configuration.
     ```
     **Use AskUserQuestion** — this is NOT optional, NOT skippable:
     - "Switch to Playwright CLI backend" (Recommended) — install CLI, re-probe, no restart needed
     - "Retry after CDP configuration" — user configures CDP for MCP, then re-run verify. Session restart ONLY needed if user chose MCP AND CLI is not available
     - "Skip UI verification — health check only" — skip Playwright UI verification, proceed with demo script health check only
     **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)
     **NEVER auto-skip this step.** The agent must wait for user's explicit choice.

  3. **Case B — CDP configured, app not running**: No user action needed. The agent starts the app itself.
     **If app was started in Phase 0**: Reuse the running instance — do NOT start a second app. Check if the Phase 0 process is still alive (`kill -0 $PID`), and if so, proceed directly to SC-level UI verification.
     **Otherwise**: Display: `ℹ️ CDP mode confirmed. Starting the app automatically.`
     Proceed to the App Launch step below.

  4. **If CDP active and app already connected**: Skip app launch, proceed directly to SC-level UI verification.

  > **Tip**: If `/reverse-spec` was run with CDP for the same Electron stack, Playwright MCP is already in CDP mode.

- **If MCP available** (MCP accelerator path — and CDP check passed for Electron) — perform App Launch + SC-level UI verification:

  **App Launch** (agent-managed — do NOT ask the user to start/restart the app):
  > **Electron note**: `_electron.launch()` for CLI mode, CDP only for MCP mode.
  1. Detect the project's dev start command from `package.json` scripts or project config (e.g., `npx electron-vite dev`, `npm run dev`)
  2. For Electron with CDP (MCP mode only): Append `-- --remote-debugging-port=9222` to the start command
  3. Start the app in background via Bash (e.g., `npx electron-vite dev -- --remote-debugging-port=9222 &`)
  4. Wait for the app to be ready: poll health endpoint or wait ~10 seconds
  5. Probe with `browser_snapshot` to confirm CDP connection:
     - If connected (app content visible) → proceed to SC verification
     - If still failing after app started → display error and HARD STOP:
       ```
       ⚠️ App started but CDP connection failed.
       ```
       **Use AskUserQuestion**:
       - "Retry" — retry the connection probe
       - "Skip UI verification — health check only"
       **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

  **SC-level UI Verification**:
  1. Build the verification target list from TWO sources:
     a. Parse demo script Coverage header → extract FR-###/SC-### + UI Action list
     b. Include ALL `cdp-auto` SCs from Step 0's SC Verification Matrix that are NOT in the Coverage header
     For (b), generate UI Action sequences based on the SC description and spec.md context
  2. Verify each SC-###:
     - ✅-marked SC: Execute UI Action sequence
       - `navigate /path` → move via Navigate capability
       - `fill selector` → input via Type capability
       - `click selector` → click via Click capability
       - `verify selector visible` → confirm element existence via Snapshot capability
       - `wait-for selector visible [timeout]` → wait until element appears (use Playwright `toBeVisible({ timeout })` or MCP poll loop)
       - `wait-for selector gone [timeout]` → wait until element disappears (use Playwright `toBeHidden({ timeout })` or MCP poll loop)
       - `wait-for selector textContent "pattern" [timeout]` → wait until element text matches (use Playwright `toHaveText` or MCP text poll)
       - `verify-scroll selector "bottom"` → evaluate `scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight - 5` via JavaScript execution
       - `trigger selector event` → dispatch event via JavaScript execution
       - `hover selector` → move cursor over element via Playwright `hover()` — for tooltips, hover menus, hover effects
       - `press-key "shortcut"` → press keyboard shortcut via Playwright `keyboard.press()` — e.g., `press-key "Control+s"`, `press-key "Escape"`
       - `drag-to source-selector target-selector` → drag element from source to target via Playwright `dragTo()` — for drag-and-drop, reorder
       - `focus selector` → focus element via Playwright `focus()` — for focus ring, focus trap, tab order verification
       - `verify-tooltip selector "expected-text"` → hover over element, wait 1s, verify tooltip/popover text content appears
       - `right-click selector` → right-click via Playwright `click({ button: 'right' })` — for context menu verification
       - `verify-animation selector property` → check computed style change after interaction — for CSS transition/animation verification (compare before/after values)
     - ⬜-marked SC: Skip (record reason)
  3. Collect JS errors from Console logs (TypeError, ReferenceError, etc.)
     **Console noise filter**: Exclude system-generated warnings that are NOT application errors:
     - Electron/Chromium anti-self-XSS: `"Don't paste code into the DevTools Console"`, `"allow pasting"`
     - Electron security warnings: `"Electron Security Warning"`
     - Node.js deprecation notices: `[DEP0` prefix
     - Chromium DevTools internal: `"DevTools failed to load"`
     - Playwright automation artifacts: warnings triggered by `evaluate()` injection
     These are automation/platform noise, not application runtime errors.
  4. Detect page load failures
  5. Result report:
  ```
  📊 UI Verification Report for [FID]:
    SC-001: ✅ navigate → fill → click → verify OK
    SC-002: ✅ navigate → click → verify OK
    SC-003: ⬜ skipped (WebSocket)
    SC-004: ⚠️ FAIL — verify .result not found after click
    Console errors: [N] (TypeError: 2, ReferenceError: 1)
  ```

  **Tier 2/3 Functional Verification** (after Tier 1 Presence verification):

  After Tier 1 (`verify selector visible`) completes for each SC, extend verification for SCs that have `verify-state` or `verify-effect` verbs in the Coverage header:

  **Tier 2 — State Change**: For SCs with `verify-state` in their UI Action sequence:
  - Execute the full UI Action sequence (navigate, fill, click) then check the specified attribute/class/text change
  - `verify-state selector attribute expected` → check DOM attribute after interaction
  - Examples: checkbox `checked` attribute, class toggled (`.active`, `.dark`), text content updated, `aria-expanded` changed
  - Wait 1 second between interaction and verification to allow state propagation

  **Tier 3 — Side Effect**: For SCs with `verify-effect` in their UI Action sequence:
  - After Tier 2 passes, check the downstream propagation on a DIFFERENT element
  - `verify-effect target-selector property expected` → check DOM property/style on the downstream target
  - Examples: theme change → `body` class contains `"dark"`, font size change → `body` style.fontSize is `"18px"`, setting save → `.toast` is visible
  - Wait 1 second between interaction and verification

  **Extended result report** (replaces the basic report above when Tier 2/3 are present):
  ```
  📊 UI Verification Report for [FID]:
    SC-001: ✅T1 ✅T2 ✅T3 — Full pass
    SC-002: ✅T1 ❌T2 (click did not toggle .active) — State change failed
    SC-003: ✅T1 ✅T2 ❌T3 (theme not applied to body) — Side effect not propagated
    SC-004: ✅T1 (no T2/T3 — presence-only SC)
    SC-005: ⬜ skipped (WebSocket)
    Console errors: [N] (TypeError: 2, ReferenceError: 1)
  ```

  If no `verify-state` or `verify-effect` verbs exist in any SC's Coverage header, skip Tiers 2/3 entirely and use the basic Tier 1 report format.

  **App Shutdown**: After all SC verifications (including Tier 2/3) complete, terminate the app process started above. Do NOT leave it running.

- **CSS Theme Token Rendering Check** (GUI Features with CSS variable-based theming):
  When the project uses CSS variable-based design tokens (e.g., `--primary`, `--background`, `--muted`) with a utility CSS framework (Tailwind CSS, UnoCSS) or component library (shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, Chakra UI):
  1. **During SC Tier 1 (presence check)**: After confirming interactive elements exist (buttons, switches, inputs), sample at least 1 styled interactive element and evaluate its `getComputedStyle()`:
     - `backgroundColor` must NOT be `transparent`, `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`, or empty
     - `color` must NOT be identical to `backgroundColor` (text invisible against background)
  2. **If transparent/invisible**: Report `⚠️ CSS Token Rendering Failure — interactive elements exist but have no visible styling. Likely cause: CSS variable theme tokens are defined but not mapped to the CSS framework's theme system (e.g., Tailwind CSS 4 requires @theme block, CSS Modules require explicit var() usage).`
  3. **Common causes by framework**:
     - Tailwind CSS 4: CSS variables defined without `@theme` block → utility classes (`bg-primary`) resolve to nothing
     - Tailwind CSS 3: CSS variables defined but `tailwind.config.js` `theme.extend.colors` doesn't reference them
     - CSS Modules: Variables defined in `:root` but not imported in component module files
  4. This check catches the "elements exist but are invisible" failure mode — build passes, type-check passes, elements are in DOM, but they render with no visible styling.
  5. **Conditional BLOCKING upgrade** (See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 2): For GUI Features using a CSS framework (Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, CSS Modules, UnoCSS): CSS Token Rendering Check failure is **BLOCKING, not WARNING**. Static checks cannot catch invisible-element failures — runtime rendering verification is the only gate. If the Feature does not use a CSS framework (plain HTML/CSS only), the check remains ⚠️ WARNING.

- **Result classification** (all warnings, NOT blocking — except CSS Token Rendering for CSS-framework Features, see item 5 above):
  - SC Tier 1 (presence) failure: ⚠️ warning (false positive possible — selector changes, etc.)
  - SC Tier 2 (state change) failure: ⚠️ warning — indicates interaction doesn't produce expected state change
  - SC Tier 3 (side effect) failure: ⚠️ warning — indicates state change doesn't propagate to downstream DOM
  - JS console errors (TypeError/ReferenceError): ⚠️ warning + highlighted
  - Page load failure: ⚠️ warning
- **UI verification failures do NOT block the overall verify result** — they are included as warnings in Review. However, this does NOT mean UI verification can be skipped without user consent. The Case A CDP HARD STOP must always be presented to the user.
- See [reference/ui-testing-integration.md](../reference/ui-testing-integration.md) for full guide

**Step 3b — Visual Fidelity Check** (rebuild mode only — skip for greenfield/add):

If `specs/reverse-spec/visual-references/manifest.md` exists AND this Feature covers screens listed in the manifest:

1. Read the manifest to identify which reference screenshots apply to this Feature (match by screen name, route, or Feature coverage from pre-context)
2. For each matching screen:
   a. Navigate to the equivalent screen in the rebuilt app (use demo URL or route from spec.md)
   b. Take a screenshot of the current rebuilt state
   c. Read BOTH the reference screenshot and current screenshot
   d. Compare: layout structure, key element presence, obvious visual regressions
3. Report per screen:
   - `✅ Visual match` — layout structure and key elements consistent
   - `⚠️ Visual deviation` — describe specific differences (missing elements, layout shift, style mismatch, color/spacing drift)
   - `❌ Major regression` — screen fundamentally different or broken
4. **Result severity** varies by `preservation_level` (read from sdd-state.md Rebuild Configuration — see `domains/scenarios/rebuild.md` §S3):
   - `exact`: Visual deviations are ⚠️ HIGH WARNING (pixel-level match expected)
   - `equivalent`: Structural deviations are ⚠️ WARNING; minor spacing/color differences informational
   - `functional`: Visual fidelity check is informational only (UI may be intentionally redesigned)
5. User can acknowledge intentional deviations ("redesigned on purpose") vs. unintentional gaps during Review

If visual references don't exist or no screens match this Feature: skip silently.

**Step 3c — Navigation Transition Sanity Check** (GUI Features only):

> Addresses the case where Feature B adds pages that share layout with Feature A, but the layout breaks on transition (e.g., header height changes, navigation shifts, content area cramped).

**Skip if**: Non-GUI Feature, or this is the first Feature (no prior Feature to transition from), or `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is `build-only` or `demo-only`.

1. **Identify transition points**:
   a. Read this Feature's routes/pages from spec.md or plan.md
   b. Read preceding Features' routes/pages from their demo scripts or spec.md
   c. Identify shared layout elements (header, navigation, sidebar — from constitution-seed.md or plan.md layout section)

2. **Execute transition verification** (when `RUNTIME_BACKEND` supports navigation — `mcp` or `cli`):
   a. Navigate to a preceding Feature's page (e.g., F001's main route)
   b. Snapshot: capture layout state (header height, nav width, content area dimensions)
   c. Navigate to this Feature's page
   d. Snapshot: capture layout state
   e. Compare shared layout elements:
      - Header: same height, same elements visible
      - Navigation: same width, same items (plus this Feature's new items)
      - Content area: proper dimensions within layout

3. **Detect layout regressions**:
   - Header height changed → `⚠️ Header layout inconsistent between [Feature A] and [Feature B] pages`
   - Navigation shifted → `⚠️ Navigation layout changed on transition`
   - Content area cramped/overflowing → `⚠️ Content area dimension mismatch`

4. Report:
   ```
   🔗 Navigation Transition Check:
     F001 /dashboard → F003 /settings: ✅ Layout consistent
     F001 /dashboard → F003 /chat: ⚠️ Header height differs (48px → 64px)
   ```

5. **Result**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking) — highlighted in Review.
6. **Without runtime backend**: Skip with notice: `ℹ️ Navigation transition check requires runtime backend — skipped.`

**Step 3d — Interactive Runtime Verification** (all interfaces):

> The core fix for "verify checks code but doesn't run the app." Exercises the Feature's actual runtime behavior using the interface-appropriate backend from Pre-flight detection.
> See [runtime-verification.md](../reference/runtime-verification.md) §6 for full per-interface protocol.

**Skip if**: `RUNTIME_BACKEND = build-only` (no runtime verification possible).

**GUI Features** (`RUNTIME_BACKEND = mcp` or `cli`):
1. Group `cdp-auto` SCs from SC Verification Matrix by user flow (from spec.md FR grouping)
2. Execute each flow as a complete interaction sequence:
   - Navigate to starting page
   - Perform user actions (click, fill, select) per SC definition
   - Verify intermediate states (Tier 2: state changes)
   - Verify end states (Tier 3: side effects, downstream propagation)
   - Verify NO console errors occurred during the flow
3. This extends Step 3 SC-level verification with flow-level verification — Step 3 verifies individual SCs, Step 3d verifies connected flows

**HTTP-API Features** (`RUNTIME_BACKEND = http-client`):

> API verification is **fully automatable** — unlike GUI, every check produces deterministic evidence (status code + response body). There is NO excuse for "build passes so verify passes" on API Features.

1. **Server startup + health check**:
   - Start server (background process)
   - Wait for health check (`GET /health` or root endpoint → 200, max 30s)
   - If health check fails → 🚫 BLOCKING (server doesn't start = Feature doesn't work)

2. **Group `api-auto` SCs by endpoint, then execute ALL**:
   For each endpoint:
   - Send request with test data (from demo fixtures or spec.md examples)
   - Verify response status code matches SC expectation
   - Verify response body shape (key fields present, correct types)
   - **Evidence format** (MANDATORY in Review):
     ```
     GET /api/users → 200 [{id:1,name:"test",email:"test@example.com"}] (42ms)
     POST /api/users {name:""} → 422 {errors:[{field:"name",message:"required"}]} (15ms)
     GET /api/users/999 → 404 {error:"Not found"} (8ms)
     ```

3. **CRUD round-trip verification** (for entities with full CRUD):
   - POST (create) → verify 201 + response contains created resource
   - GET (read) → verify 200 + response matches what was created
   - PUT/PATCH (update) → verify 200 + response reflects changes
   - DELETE → verify 204 or 200
   - GET (re-read) → verify 404 (actually deleted)
   - If ANY step fails → the CRUD chain is broken → 🚫 BLOCKING

4. **Auth enforcement verification**:
   - Send request WITHOUT auth token → verify 401 + actionable error message
   - Send request WITH invalid/expired token → verify 401 + specific error
   - Send request WITH valid token → verify 200 + expected response
   - If auth endpoint exists: test login flow → receive token → use token
   - **BLOCKING** if auth-protected endpoint returns 200 without token

5. **Input validation verification**:
   - Send request with missing required fields → verify 400/422 + error specifies which field
   - Send request with wrong types → verify 400/422
   - Send request with boundary values (empty string, max length, negative number)
   - Verify error response format is **consistent** across all endpoints

6. **Error response consistency check**:
   - Collect all error responses from steps 2-5
   - Verify they all use the same envelope format (e.g., `{error, code, message}`)
   - Inconsistent error format = ⚠️ WARNING

7. **Integration Contract verification** (if Feature provides API for other Features):
   - For each "Provides →" in plan.md Integration Contracts:
     - Call the endpoint with the consumer's expected input
     - Verify response contains ALL fields the consumer needs
     - This is NOT just "endpoint returns 200" — it's "response has fields X, Y, Z"

8. **Server cleanup**:
   - Kill server process (graceful SIGTERM first, SIGKILL after 5s)
   - Verify port is released (`lsof -i :PORT` shows nothing)
   - If server process leaks → ⚠️ WARNING (future port conflicts)

**CLI Features** (`RUNTIME_BACKEND = process-runner`):
1. Group `cli-auto` SCs by command
2. For each command:
   - Execute with test arguments (from spec.md examples)
   - Capture stdout, stderr, exit code
   - Verify exit code matches expectation
   - Verify stdout matches expected pattern (substring, regex, or JSON shape)
   - Verify error handling (invalid args → non-zero exit + helpful message, not stack trace)

**Data-IO Features** (`RUNTIME_BACKEND = pipeline-runner`):
1. Group `pipeline-auto` SCs by pipeline stage
2. For each stage:
   - Prepare test input data (from demo fixtures)
   - Execute pipeline
   - Compare output: schema match, row/record counts, key value spot checks
   - Verify no error logs during execution

**`user-assisted` SCs** (all interfaces):
> See [user-cooperation-protocol.md](../reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md) §3.
1. Before verifying `user-assisted` SCs, batch ALL user preparation requests into one prompt:
   ```
   📋 User-Assisted Verification for [FID]:
     SC-023: Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
     SC-031: Requires MCP server running on localhost:3001

   Please prepare these dependencies, then confirm.
   ```
2. **Use AskUserQuestion**:
   - "Dependencies ready — proceed with verification"
   - "Skip user-assisted SCs"
   **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)
3. If "Dependencies ready": re-verify each dependency (probe API key presence, service endpoint) → run automated verification (same as auto categories)
4. If "Skip": record as `⚠️ user-assisted — skipped`

**Per-SC Depth Tracking** (MANDATORY — enforces SC Minimum Depth Rule from Step 0):

After executing each SC's verification, record the **Reached Depth** and compare against the **Required Depth** from the SC Verification Matrix:
- If Reached Depth ≥ Required Depth → ✅ Depth satisfied
- If Reached Depth < Required Depth → `⚠️ SC-### depth shortfall: required Tier [N] but only reached Tier [M]`
  - For behavioral SCs (Required Depth = Tier 2): This means the agent only confirmed element presence but did NOT verify the state change. **Agent MUST retry with a Tier 2 verification** (perform the action, check state mutation) before marking the SC as verified.
  - If retry still cannot reach Required Depth (e.g., action triggers an error, state mutation path is broken): record as `⚠️ SC-### Tier 2 unreachable — [reason]` in the report. This is a strong indicator of a runtime bug — **do NOT attempt to fix the code inline**. Record the failure and let it surface in Review. If a fix is needed, the Source Modification Gate applies (run Pre-Fix Classification before touching any source file).

**Result report** (appended to SC Verification report):
```
📊 Interactive Runtime Verification for [FID]:
  Flow 1 (Settings → Theme): ✅ All 3 SCs passed (2 state changes, 1 side effect)
    SC-022: ✅ Tier 2 reached (required: Tier 2) — server added, status verified
    SC-023a: ✅ Tier 2 reached (required: Tier 2) — tool panel opened, list rendered
    SC-024: ✅ Tier 1 reached (required: Tier 1) — tool list visible
  Flow 2 (Chat → Send): ⚠️ SC-025 timeout (loading state did not clear within 10s)
    SC-025: ⚠️ Tier 2 unreachable — timeout during state change verification
  API /api/settings: ✅ GET 200, POST 200, invalid POST 422
  user-assisted: 2/3 verified (1 skipped — external API unavailable)

  Depth Compliance: 4/5 SCs met required depth (1 shortfall)
```

**Step 3d2 — Interaction Chain Verify Method Execution** (GUI Features with plan.md Interaction Chains):

> Bridges the plan→verify gap: plan.md defines Verify Method for each Interaction Chain row, but without this step those definitions are dead columns.

**Skip if**: plan.md has no `## Interaction Chains` section, or Feature has no GUI interface.

1. Read `specs/{NNN-feature}/plan.md` → extract the Interaction Chains table
2. For each row with a non-empty `Verify Method` column:
   - Parse the verb: `verify-state selector attribute "expected"` → `expect(page.locator(selector)).toHaveAttribute(attribute, expected)`
   - Parse the verb: `verify-effect target property "expected"` → evaluate via `page.evaluate()` + assert
   - Parse the verb: `verify-state selector class "expected"` → `expect(page.locator(selector)).toHaveClass(/expected/)`
3. Execute the chain **in order**: User Action → wait for DOM Effect → run Verify Method assertion
4. Record result per chain row: PASS / FAIL with details
5. FAIL items → classify per Bug Fix Severity Rule (same as other verify failures)

**Result report** (appended after Step 3d report):
```
── Interaction Chain Verification ──────────────
  Chain 1 (FR-012 Theme toggle): ✅ verify-effect body class "dark" PASS
  Chain 2 (FR-015 Font size):    ✅ verify-effect body style.fontSize "18px" PASS
  Chain 3 (FR-018 Sidebar):      ❌ verify-state .sidebar class "hidden" FAIL — sidebar still visible
  Total: 2/3 PASS
────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Step 3d3 — Demo TEST PLAN Execution** (when demo script contains TEST PLAN block):

> Ensures that the TEST PLAN written in implement is not a dead document — each test scenario is actually executed and verified during verify.

**Skip if**: Demo script has no `# ── TEST PLAN` or `# ── Test N:` comment block.

1. Parse the demo script's TEST PLAN block → extract each test item (precondition, action, expected, confirmation)
2. Classify each test item:
   - **auto**: UI action + DOM state check → execute via Playwright
   - **semi-auto**: UI action possible but expected result requires visual judgment → Playwright screenshot + agent comparison against expected description
   - **manual-only**: OS-level action (file dialog, app restart, hardware), external dependency → routed to user-assisted manual verification in Step 3f2
3. Execute auto and semi-auto items via Playwright:
   - Perform the action (click, fill, navigate, toggle)
   - Assert the expected result (DOM state, attribute, visual comparison)
   - Record PASS/FAIL per item
4. FAIL items → classify per Bug Fix Severity Rule
5. Manual-only items → accumulated for Step 3f2 (do NOT silently skip)
6. Display result in verify Review:
```
── Demo TEST PLAN Execution ─────────────────
  Total: 9 tests | Auto: 5 PASS | Semi-auto: 2 PASS | Manual: 2 → Step 3f2
────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

**Step 3e — Source App Comparative Verification** (rebuild mode only):

> Guard 3: Cross-Stage Trust Breakers — Gate 3 (verify Phase 3e). MANDATORY source app
> comparison for rebuild+GUI — independently verifies runtime-configurable settings against
> the source app, catching trust breaker errors that propagated through earlier stages.
> See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 3.
>
> Guard 7: Rebuild Fidelity Chain. Final verification in the fidelity chain — source app
> comparison confirms the rebuild matches the original. This is the BLOCKING endpoint of
> the chain that started at reverse-spec. See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 7.

> In rebuild mode, compare the rebuilt app against the original running app for behavioral parity.
> Only when Origin=`rebuild` AND `source_available: running` in sdd-state.md scenario config.
> See [user-cooperation-protocol.md](../reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md) § Source App Access.

**Skip conditions**:
- Not rebuild mode, OR Source Path is N/A → skip entirely

> **🚫 MANDATORY for rebuild + GUI**: When Origin=`rebuild` AND `gui` is in active Interfaces, source app comparison is BLOCKING, not optional. The agent MUST attempt to start and compare against the source app. Without source comparison, errors like wrong layout mode defaults propagate undetected through the entire pipeline (see SKF-014, SKF-024).

**Prerequisite**: Source app must be running. Detection:
1. Read Source Path from sdd-state.md
2. Probe source app (curl health endpoint or process check)
3. If not running → **attempt to start** the source app (read the project's script configuration, try the detected dev start command)
4. If start attempt fails → **Fallback to static visual references**:
   a. Check if `specs/reverse-spec/visual-references/manifest.md` exists
   b. If exists → use static screenshots for comparison (same as Step 3b) and record: `⚠️ Source app unavailable — used static visual references as fallback`
   c. If no static references either → **HARD STOP** — Use AskUserQuestion:
      ```
      ⚠️ Source App Comparison BLOCKED for rebuild GUI Feature [FID]:
        Source app: cannot be started ([reason])
        Static visual references: not found

      Without ANY visual reference, parity verification is impossible.
      Feature verify status will be "unverified-visual" (not "success").
      ```
      - "Start source app manually — I'll provide the port" → agent captures reference and compares
      - "Provide screenshots — I'll place them in visual-references/" → user provides, agent re-checks
      - "Acknowledge — proceed with unverified-visual status" → record `⚠️ UNVERIFIED-VISUAL` in sdd-state.md (Feature status = `limited`, not `success`)
      **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

   > **Why single "skip and acknowledge risk" is insufficient**: A single acknowledgment hides the severity. Marking the Feature as `limited` (not `success`) makes the gap visible in sdd-state.md and blocks merge unless the user explicitly overrides the verify-gate.

**Comparison procedure** (when both apps are running):

Comparison criteria vary by `preservation_level` (read from sdd-state.md Rebuild Configuration — see `domains/scenarios/rebuild.md` §S3):
- `exact`: Byte-level response comparison (API), pixel-level screenshot comparison (UI). Any deviation = ⚠️ WARNING
- `equivalent`: Data shape and semantic comparison. Format differences (JSON key order, whitespace) ignored. Same data values required
- `functional`: Goal-level comparison. Same user flow produces same outcome. UI appearance and API format may differ

1. For each page/route in this Feature:
   a. Navigate to the page in the REBUILT app → Snapshot A
   b. Navigate to the equivalent page in the SOURCE app → Snapshot B (requires separate browser context or port)
   c. Compare (apply criteria above):
      - Layout structure: element positions, container hierarchy
      - Data presentation: same data shape displayed
      - Interaction behavior: same click targets produce same outcomes
2. For API endpoints (if http-api interface):
   a. Send same request to both apps
   b. Compare response status codes and body shapes (apply criteria above)
3. Report:
   ```
   📊 Source App Comparison for [FID]:
     /settings page: ✅ Layout match, ✅ Data match
     /chat page: ⚠️ Layout deviation — sidebar width differs (240px vs 200px)
     GET /api/config: ✅ Response shape match
   ```

**Result**:
- **rebuild + GUI**: ⚠️ BLOCKING if layout structure deviations detected. The user must explicitly acknowledge each deviation before proceeding. Layout mode mismatches (e.g., sidebar vs tab mode) are Critical — cannot be acknowledged as "intentional" without justification.
- **rebuild + non-GUI**: ⚠️ warnings (NOT blocking). User can acknowledge intentional deviations during Review.
- **non-rebuild**: N/A (this step is rebuild-only).

**Note on dual-app management**: The agent manages both apps. Source app port must differ from rebuilt app port. If both are Electron, they need different CDP ports.

**Step 3f — User-Assisted SC Completion Gate** (MANDATORY — cannot skip):

> **Why this separate gate exists**: The `user-assisted` SCs block in Step 3d is a subsection among several auto-category subsections. Agents tend to process the auto categories and skip the user-assisted block entirely. This gate is a safety net that BLOCKS progression to Step 4 until user-assisted SCs are explicitly resolved.

1. **Read SC Verification Matrix from Step 0**: Count SCs classified as `user-assisted`.
2. **If count = 0**: No user-assisted SCs → proceed to Step 4.
3. **If count > 0**: Check whether ALL user-assisted SCs have been resolved (verified ✅ or explicitly skipped via AskUserQuestion in Step 3d).
4. **If any user-assisted SCs remain unresolved** (neither verified nor explicitly skipped by user choice):
   - Batch ALL unresolved user-assisted SCs into one cooperation request:
     ```
     📋 User-Assisted Verification for [FID]:
       SC-023: Requires OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
       SC-031: Requires MCP server running on localhost:3001

     These SCs can be verified if you provide the dependencies above.
     Please prepare them, then confirm — or choose to skip.
     ```
   - **Use AskUserQuestion**:
     - "Dependencies ready — proceed with verification"
     - "Skip user-assisted SCs — record as ⚠️"
     **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)
   - If "Dependencies ready": re-verify each dependency (probe API key presence, service endpoint) → run automated verification (same as auto categories)
   - If "Skip": record each as `⚠️ user-assisted — skipped (user chose to skip)`
5. **`external-dep` re-classification check**: Review `external-dep` SCs from Step 0. If any could realistically be provided by the user (API key the user likely has, local service the user can start), reclassify as `user-assisted` and include in the cooperation request above. See [user-cooperation-protocol.md](../reference/user-cooperation-protocol.md) §3 for classification criteria.

> **BLOCKING**: Do NOT proceed to Step 4 until this gate is passed. Marking `user-assisted` SCs as `⚠️` without presenting AskUserQuestion to the user is a protocol violation.

**Step 3f2 — User-Assisted Manual Verification** (MANDATORY when manual items exist):

> **Principle: "자동화 불가 ≠ 검증 스킵"**. Automation-impossible items must still be verified — through user cooperation, not silent omission. This gate ensures every verification item is either machine-verified, user-verified, or explicitly acknowledged as unverifiable.

**Sources** — accumulate all items that couldn't be auto-verified from prior steps:
- `manual` SCs from SC Verification Matrix (Step 0)
- `manual-only` TEST PLAN items from Step 3d3
- Interaction Chain rows that failed Playwright execution and need visual confirmation (Step 3d2)

**Skip if**: No manual/manual-only items accumulated from any source.

1. **Present manual verification checklist to user** via AskUserQuestion:
   ```
   📋 Manual Verification for [FID] — [N] items need your confirmation:

   From SC Matrix:
     SC-045: "Animation completes within 300ms" — visual timing judgment
     SC-052: "Print dialog opens with correct layout" — OS dialog interaction

   From TEST PLAN:
     Test 3: Settings persistence after app restart
     Test 7: File export opens OS save dialog

   For each item, please:
   1. Perform the action described
   2. Observe whether the expected result occurs
   3. Report PASS or FAIL (with what you observed if FAIL)
   ```
   - Options: "All PASS", "Some FAIL — [details]", "Cannot test now — defer"
   **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)

2. **Record results**:
   - "All PASS" → record each as `✅ manual — user-verified`
   - "Some FAIL" → classify per Bug Fix Severity Rule (same as auto failures)
   - "Cannot test now" → record as `⚠️ manual — deferred (user unavailable)`. This does NOT block merge but is recorded in verify Notes as a limitation

3. **Display in verify Review**:
```
── User-Assisted Manual Verification ───────────
  SC Matrix: 2 items | 2 PASS (user-verified)
  TEST PLAN: 2 items | 1 PASS, 1 deferred (app restart — user unavailable)
  Total: 4 items | 3 verified, 1 deferred
────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

> **Why not just skip?** Silent skip creates a false sense of coverage — "verify passed" implies everything was checked. With this gate, unverified items are explicitly recorded, and the user has the opportunity to catch bugs that automation cannot.

**Step 4 — Check coverage mapping and demo components**:
- The demo script must include a **Coverage** header comment mapping FR-###/SC-### from spec.md to what the user can try/see in the demo
  - Each FR/SC should be either ✅ (demonstrated) or ⬜ (not demoed with reason)
  - **Aim for maximum coverage** — every functional requirement should be experienceable in the demo unless genuinely impossible
  - If coverage is below 50% of the Feature's FR count, **WARN** the user and suggest expanding the demo
- The demo script must include a **Demo Components** header comment listing each component as Demo-only or Promotable
- Demo-only components are marked with `// @demo-only` (removed after all Features complete)
- Promotable components are marked with `// @demo-scaffold — will be extended by F00N-[feature]`

**Step 5 — Validate CI/Interactive path convergence**:
Before running the demo, **read the demo script source** and verify:
- The `if [ "$CI_MODE" = true ]` exit point comes **AFTER** the actual Feature startup command (e.g., `npm run dev`, `tauri dev`, server start), not before
- CI mode and interactive mode use the **same startup commands** — CI must not take a shortcut path (e.g., only checking build without starting the Feature)
- **REJECT if**: the CI branch exits before the Feature's main process is started — this means CI can pass while the actual demo fails

> **Why this matters**: A demo that passes CI but fails for the user is worse than no CI check at all. Example: CI checks "frontend build" → passes. User runs the demo → `tauri: command not found`. The CI check gave false confidence.

**Step 6 — Execute the demo in CI mode (`--ci`)**:
- Run `demos/F00N-name.sh --ci` and verify it completes without errors
- The demo script's CI mode MUST include a **stability window** (15 seconds — 3 probes at 5s intervals per demo-standard.md) between the initial health check and exit — verify the script includes this (see demo-standard.md template)
- If the demo script lacks a stability window (exits immediately after first health check), **WARN** and recommend updating the script to include one
- Capture the demo output (stdout/stderr) for the Review display
- **Runtime error scan (BLOCKING)**: After demo execution, scan the captured stdout/stderr for runtime error patterns:
  - `"level":"error"` or `"level":"fatal"` (structured log errors)
  - `Error occurred`, `Unhandled rejection`, `Uncaught exception`
  - `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError` (JS runtime errors)
  - `No handler registered`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOENT` (service initialization failures)
  - `panic:`, `FATAL`, `segfault` (system-level crashes)
  - Process exit with non-zero code
  > These patterns are JS/Node.js-centric. For other languages, scan for equivalent error indicators (e.g., Python `Traceback`, Go `goroutine panic`, Rust `thread panicked`).
- **If runtime errors are detected**: The demo is considered **FAILED** even if the health check (HTTP 200) passed — a healthy port does not mean the application is functioning correctly (e.g., Vite dev server may respond while Electron main process has fatal errors)
- Display each detected error with its source line for user review
- **Browser console error scan (MCP supplement)**: After demo --ci passes the stdout/stderr scan above, if `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP` is `supplement` or `primary` (i.e., MCP tools available in session):
  1. Navigate to the app's main URL (from demo script's "Try it" output or health check URL)
  2. Wait 5 seconds for the page to stabilize
  3. Read browser Console logs for: `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, framework-specific infinite loop warnings (e.g., React `Maximum update depth exceeded`), `unhandled rejection`, infinite render warnings
     **Exclude platform noise**: Filter out Electron/Chromium system warnings (`"Don't paste code"`, `"Electron Security Warning"`, `[DEP0` deprecation, DevTools internal messages) — these are automation artifacts, not app errors
  4. **If browser console errors detected**: Demo is FAILED even if health endpoint returned 200 and stdout was clean — these are client-side-only bugs (infinite re-renders, selector instability, DOM timing) that never appear in server output
  5. Display: `❌ Browser console errors detected: [N] errors — [first error message]`
  6. If `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP = unavailable`: Skip browser console scan. Display: `ℹ️ Browser console scan skipped (Playwright MCP not available in this session)`

**If any check fails**, display and BLOCK:
```
❌ Demo-Ready verification failed for [FID] - [Feature Name]:
  - [Missing: demos/F00N-name.sh | --ci health check failed: <error> | Demo is test-only (no live Feature) | Missing: Demo Components header | Missing: component markers]

"Tests pass" alone does not satisfy Demo-Ready Delivery.
A demo must launch the real, working Feature so the user can experience it.
Please create a demo script at demos/F00N-name.sh that:
  - Starts the Feature and prints "Try it" instructions (default)
  - Supports --ci for automated health check (verify phase)
  - Includes Demo Components with appropriate category markers
```

**Use AskUserQuestion** with options:
- "Fix and re-verify" — user will fix, then re-run `/smart-sdd verify`
- "Show failure details" — display full demo script output
- "Acknowledge limited verification" — proceed with ⚠️ limited-verify (requires reason)

**If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1). **Do NOT proceed to Phase 4** until the demo passes **OR** the user explicitly acknowledges limited verification.

**Limited-verify exception path** (same as Phase 1): If the user selects "Acknowledge limited verification":
1. Ask for the reason (e.g., "Demo requires Feature B's UI not yet built", "No frontend in this Feature — pure library")
2. Append to `sdd-state.md` Feature Detail Log → verify Notes: `⚠️ DEMO-LIMITED — [reason]`
3. If Phase 1 already passed normally, set verify icon to `⚠️` (limited) instead of ✅
4. Proceed to Phase 4

- Update `demos/README.md` (Demo Hub) with the Feature's demo and what the user can experience:
  - `./demos/F00N-name.sh` — launches [brief description of the live demo experience]

**Step 6b — Execute VERIFY_STEPS** (if runtime backend supports interactive verification and VERIFY_STEPS block exists):

After demo `--ci` passes, check for a `# VERIFY_STEPS:` comment block in the demo script:

1. Parse the demo script for a `# VERIFY_STEPS:` comment block (lines starting with `#   ` after `# VERIFY_STEPS:`)
2. If block exists AND `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is `mcp`:
   - Keep the app running (from the demo `--ci --verify` invocation)
   - Execute each step via Playwright MCP using the same verbs as SC-level verification:
     - `navigate /path` → Navigate to URL
     - `click selector` → Click element
     - `fill selector value` → Fill input field
     - `verify selector visible` → Tier 1: confirm element exists
     - `verify-state selector attribute "expected"` → Tier 2: check DOM attribute after interaction
     - `verify-effect target-selector property "expected"` → Tier 3: check downstream DOM propagation
     - `wait-for selector visible [timeout]` → wait until element appears (poll with timeout, default 10s)
     - `wait-for selector gone [timeout]` → wait until element disappears (poll with timeout)
     - `wait-for selector textContent "pattern" [timeout]` → wait until element text matches pattern
     - `verify-scroll selector "bottom"` → evaluate `scrollTop + clientHeight >= scrollHeight - 5` via JavaScript
     - `trigger selector event` → dispatch event via JavaScript execution
   - Wait 1 second between interaction and verification steps (temporal verbs handle their own timeouts)
   - Report per-step results:
     ```
     📊 VERIFY_STEPS Functional Verification:
       Step 1: navigate /settings → ✅
       Step 2: click button#theme-toggle → ✅
       Step 3: verify-state html class "dark" → ❌ (class is still "light")
       Step 4: navigate /settings/display → ✅
       Step 5: fill input#font-size 18 → ✅
       Step 6: verify-effect body style.fontSize "18px" → ✅
       Result: 5/6 passed, 1 failed
     ```
   - `verify-state`/`verify-effect` failures → ⚠️ **warning** (NOT blocking)
3. If VERIFY_STEPS block not found: `ℹ️ Functional verification not configured — VERIFY_STEPS block absent in demo script`
4. If `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is `cli` or `cli-limited` AND `demos/verify/F00N-name.spec.ts` (or `.spec.js`) exists:
   - Ensure app is running (from demo `--ci` execution in Step 6)
   - Run: `npx playwright test demos/verify/F00N-name.spec.ts --reporter=list`
   - Parse test results (pass/fail per test case)
   - Report in same format as MCP-driven VERIFY_STEPS above
   - Display: `ℹ️ Functional verification via Playwright CLI`
5. If `RUNTIME_BACKEND` is `demo-only` or `build-only` AND no test file exists: skip with notice:
   `⚠️ Functional verification skipped — no runtime backend available and no test file (demos/verify/F00N-name.spec.ts)`

**SC Verification Coverage Summary** (after Steps 3 + 6b complete):

Compile the final SC Verification Matrix by combining results from all verification sources:
- Phase 1 tests → `test-covered` SCs
- Step 3 SC-level UI verification → `cdp-auto` SCs (result: ✅/❌/⚠️)
- Step 6b VERIFY_STEPS → functional SCs (result: ✅/❌/⚠️)
- Step 0 classifications → `external-dep` / `manual` SCs (skip reason)

Display:
```
📊 SC Verification Coverage for [FID]:
  Total SCs: [N]
  ✅ Verified (auto + test-covered): [N] ([%])
  ✅ Verified (user-assisted — after cooperation): [N] ([%])
  ⚠️ Skipped — user-assisted (user chose to skip): [N] ([list SC])
  ⚠️ Skipped — external dependency: [N] ([list SC + reason])
  ⚠️ Skipped — manual only: [N]
  ❌ Failed: [N] ([list SC + failure])
  Effective coverage: [verified / total] = [N]%
```

**Coverage gate**:
- Effective coverage ≥ 50%: Proceed normally
- Effective coverage < 50%: Display `⚠️ SC verification coverage is [N]% — most SCs lack runtime verification`. This is a WARNING, not a blocker — but it is prominently displayed in Review for user awareness. If `cdp-auto` SCs exist that were NOT verified (Step 3 skipped due to MCP unavailability), recommend installing MCP.

### Phase 3b: Bug Prevention Verification (B-4)

> Additional checks to automatically verify basic stability of code written during implement.
> Runs after Phase 3 Demo-Ready, before Phase 4 Update.

**CI Propagation Check (greenfield only)**: Read `CI Low-confidence` from sdd-state.md. If CI < 40%: add **empty-state checks for each low-CI area** — verify the Feature handles undefined/missing data gracefully for dimensions that were vague at project start. For example, if Scale & Scope was low-confidence and no scale decisions were made, verify the app doesn't crash under minimal load. If Constraints confidence ≤ 1: no additional checks (constraints clarify during implementation — per `reference/clarity-index.md` § 6).

**Empty State Smoke Test** — "Empty State ≠ PASS":

> Principle: A Feature that renders an empty state without errors is NOT automatically passing.
> If the Feature is supposed to display data and the data area is empty with no intentional
> empty-state message, that is an INCOMPLETE state, not a PASS.

- Start app with all stores/state set to initial (empty) state
- Confirm main screen renders without crashes (Error Boundary not triggered)
- Confirm no critical JS errors in Console (TypeError, ReferenceError, etc.)
- **When runtime backend supports navigation** (`RUNTIME_BACKEND = mcp`): Auto-verify via Navigate → Snapshot
- **Without navigation capability**: Substitute with build + server start success check
- **Data presence check** (NEW):
  - Read spec.md FR-### to identify what data the Feature should display
  - If the Feature manages/displays data (list, table, form with defaults):
    - Check if the data area is populated OR shows an intentional empty state message
    - "No items yet" / "Add your first..." / "No results" / placeholder text = ✅ intentional empty state
    - Blank area with no content and no empty-state indicator = `⚠️ Empty State — data area has no content and no empty-state indicator. Possible missing data source or unimplemented empty state UI.`
  - This check helps catch cross-Feature data dependency issues (e.g., Feature depends on AI model data that isn't populated)

**Seeded State Verification** — "Dual-Mode: Clean + Seeded" (See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 5):

> Principle: Clean-state verification alone is INSUFFICIENT. Features that read from persistent
> storage pass in Playwright's isolated `_electron.launch()` environment but fail in the user's
> real environment with non-default settings and accumulated data.

- **BLOCKING** for Features that read from persistent storage (electron-store, SQLite, localStorage, IndexedDB)
- **⚠️ WARNING** for Features with no persistent storage dependency (included in Review but not blocking)

**Protocol — both A and B must pass**:

A. **Clean Environment** (already covered by Empty State Smoke Test above):
   - Playwright `_electron.launch()` with isolated userData
   - Baseline rendering + default-setting functionality

B. **Seeded Environment** (non-default, real-world state):
   - Launch with non-default settings: fontSize extremes (e.g., 12, 24), non-default language, non-default theme
   - Option 1: `_electron.launch()` with `--user-data-dir` pointing to a pre-seeded test profile
   - Option 2: Dev server + Playwright MCP `browser_navigate(localhost:port)` with seeded localStorage/store
   - Option 3: Screenshot request to user (last resort — when programmatic seeding is infeasible)
   - Verify: UI renders correctly with non-default values, no layout overflow, no invisible text, no hardcoded defaults overriding persisted values

**Test State Isolation Rules** (mandatory for all seeded-state tests):
1. **Reset or detect**: Before each test, reset to a known state OR detect current state before asserting
2. **Toggle tests**: Read current value → change to opposite → verify change (NEVER assume initial state)
3. **Order-independent**: Each test scenario must be independent — no dependency on previous test's side effects

**Result**: If Feature has persistent storage dependency and Seeded Environment (B) is not verified → `❌ BLOCKING — Dual-Mode Verification incomplete. Seeded state not tested.`

**Smoke Launch Criteria** (basic app stability):
1. Process starts — no immediate exit with non-zero exit code
2. Main screen renders — not a blank page or error screen
3. Error Boundary not triggered — React/Vue/Svelte error boundaries not activated
4. No JS errors — Console free of TypeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError

**Result classification**: ⚠️ warning (NOT blocking) — results included in Review

---

> **⚠️ Source Modification Gate reminder** — Between Phase 3b and Phase 4 (Global Evolution Update), the pipeline displays Review results to the user. If the user requests fixes based on Review, or if the agent identifies issues to fix before committing results, the **Source Modification Gate MUST be executed** before touching ANY source file. This is the most common point where agents violate the Bug Fix Severity Rule — user feedback triggers a "fix it now" bias that bypasses severity classification. **STOP → List changes → Classify → Aggregate file count → If Major: HARD STOP regression, not inline fix.**

### SC Verification Evidence Gate (🚫 BLOCKING — before Review)

> **Why this gate exists (SKF-068)**: Agents exhibit a 3-stage verification evasion pattern: (1) code review → "code path exists" → SC ✅, (2) surface UI check → "button renders" → SC ✅, (3) only after user complaint → actual data flow verification. This gate BLOCKS Review approval unless runtime evidence is submitted for each SC.

**🚨 Level 1 (code review) alone CANNOT pass any SC. This is absolute.**

Before assembling the verify Review, check the SC Verification Matrix for evidence:

1. **Evidence requirement per SC category**:

| Category | Required Evidence | Example |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| `cdp-auto` | Playwright execution log: action → state change → assertion result | `click KB button → popover.visible=true → select KB → store.knowledge_bases.length=1` |
| `api-auto` | HTTP request/response log: method, URL, status, response body snippet | `POST /api/users → 201 {id:5,name:"test"}` |
| `cli-auto` | Command + stdout/stderr + exit code | `myapp --config test.yml → exit 0, output: "3 items processed"` |
| `pipeline-auto` | Pipeline execution log + output comparison | `pipeline.run(test.csv) → output 50 rows, schema matches expected` |
| `test-covered` | Test name + pass/fail result from Phase 1 | `test_user_creation (PASSED)` |
| `user-assisted` | User's response recorded via AskUserQuestion | `user-verified: "KB search returns relevant results"` |
| `os-native` | User's response recorded via AskUserQuestion | `user-verified: "drag&drop adds file, status → processing"` |
| `external-dep` | Explicit skip reason | `Production-only API, no local mock available` |

2. **Evidence audit**: For each SC in the matrix:
   - If category is auto (`cdp-auto`, `api-auto`, `cli-auto`, `pipeline-auto`) but **no runtime execution log exists** → 🚫 **BLOCKING**
   - Display: `🚫 SC-### has no runtime evidence. Category is [cdp-auto] but only code review was performed. Run Playwright/HTTP verification before Review.`
   - If category is `user-assisted` or `os-native` but **no AskUserQuestion response recorded** → 🚫 **BLOCKING**
   - Display: `🚫 SC-### requires user verification but user was never asked. Call AskUserQuestion now.`

3. **Anti-patterns (검증 회피 패턴 — 이것들은 모두 BLOCKING 위반)**:
   ```
   ❌ WRONG (Level 1 — 코드 리뷰):
     "Explore agent로 useChatStore.ts 확인 → knowledge:search 함수 존재 → SC-002 ✅"
     → 코드가 존재하는 것과 실행되는 것은 다름. hydrate 누락, 파라미터 불일치 감지 불가.

   ❌ WRONG (Level 2 — 표면 UI):
     "Playwright snapshot → KB 버튼 visible → SC-002 ✅"
     → UI가 보이는 것과 데이터가 흐르는 것은 다름. 버튼 클릭 후 실제 IPC 호출 여부 미확인.

   ✅ RIGHT (Level 3 — 데이터 흐름):
     "Playwright: KB 생성 → 파일 추가 → assistant에 KB 연결 → 메시지 전송
      → interceptor: knowledge:search called=true, results.length=3
      → AI 응답에 KB 참조 포함 확인 → SC-002 ✅"
   ```

4. **Review에 Evidence Summary 표시 (MANDATORY)**:
   ```
   📊 SC Verification Evidence Summary:
   | SC | Category | Depth | Evidence |
   |----|----------|-------|---------|
   | SC-001 | cdp-auto | Tier 2 | ✅ Playwright: click → state change verified |
   | SC-002 | cdp-auto | Tier 3 | ✅ Playwright: E2E flow + IPC interceptor |
   | SC-003 | user-assisted | Tier 2 | ✅ User confirmed: "drag&drop works" |
   | SC-004 | external-dep | — | ⏭️ Skip: production API only |

   Evidence coverage: 3/4 SCs verified (75%)
   ```
   **If any auto-category SC has no evidence → BLOCK ReviewApproval.** User cannot approve verify results that lack runtime evidence.

### Phase 4: Global Evolution Update

**Step 4a. Registry Consistency Verification**:
- entity-registry.md: Verify that the actually implemented entity schemas match the registry; update if discrepancies are found
- api-registry.md: Verify that the actually implemented API contracts match the registry; update if discrepancies are found
- **REGISTRY-DRIFT resolution**: If implement marked this Feature with `⚠️ REGISTRY-DRIFT` in sdd-state.md, this phase MUST resolve all flagged inconsistencies:
  - Read the REGISTRY-DRIFT details from Feature Detail Log
  - Cross-check each flagged item against the actual implementation
  - Update registry entries to match reality (implementation is the source of truth at this point)
  - Remove the `⚠️ REGISTRY-DRIFT` flag after resolution
  - Display: `✅ Registry drift resolved: [N] entity entries and [M] API entries updated to match implementation`

**Step 4b. Dependency Stub Status Check**:

> Guard 6c: Dependency Stub Resolution. Verify that stubs recorded during preceding
> Features' implement are resolved by this Feature's implementation.
> See pipeline-integrity-guards.md § Guard 6.

- If this Feature resolves stubs from a preceding Feature: verify the stubs are actually resolved (real implementation replaces placeholder)
- If this Feature has `⚠️ STUB-DEPENDENT` flag: verify the stubs it depends on are still present and compatible
- Update stubs.md of affected Features if resolution status changed

**Step 4c. State Update**:
- sdd-state.md: Record verification results — **status MUST be one of `success`, `limited`, or `failure`**, plus test pass/fail counts, build result, and verification timestamp. The merge step checks this status as a gate condition.
  - `success`: All phases passed normally
  - `limited`: User acknowledged limited verification in Phase 1 or Phase 3 (⚠️ marker). Merge is allowed with a reminder
  - `failure`: One or more phases failed without acknowledgment. Merge is blocked

**Process cleanup**: After Phase 4 update completes (or if verify exits early due to failure/regression), execute the Verify Process Lifecycle Protocol cleanup — kill all PIDs in the registry. This applies regardless of verify outcome (success, limited, failure, regression).

---

### Phase 5: Integration Demo Trigger (HARD STOP — conditional)

> This phase runs only when all Phases 0-4 complete with `success` or `limited` status. For detailed post-step update procedures (registry updates, SBI coverage, merge workflow), see [injection/verify.md](../reference/injection/verify.md) § Post-Step Update Rules.

After the Feature passes verification, check whether it completes a Demo Group:

1. Read `sdd-state.md` Demo Group Progress section
2. Identify which Demo Group(s) contain this Feature
3. For each group: check if all other Features are already `completed` or `adopted`
4. If this Feature is the **last pending Feature** in a Demo Group:
   - Run `scripts/demo-status.sh <project-root>` to confirm group completion status
   - **HARD STOP** — Use AskUserQuestion:
     ```
     🎯 All Features in [DG-0N: Scenario] are now verified!
     Run Integration Demo to verify the end-to-end scenario?
     ```
     Options: "Run Integration Demo", "Defer Integration Demo"
     **If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1)
   - If "Run Integration Demo": execute per [demo-standard.md § 7](../reference/demo-standard.md)
   - If "Defer": record `⏳ deferred` in Demo Group Progress and continue to merge
5. If this Feature does NOT complete any Demo Group: skip this phase entirely
