## Verify Command

Running `/smart-sdd verify [FID]` performs post-implementation verification. This step runs **after implement** to validate that the actual code works correctly and is consistent with the broader project.

### Phase 1: Execution Verification (BLOCKING)

Run each check and record results. **If any check fails, verification is BLOCKED — do not proceed to Phase 2/3/4.**

1. **Test check**: Detect and execute the project's test command (from `package.json` scripts, `pyproject.toml`, `Makefile`, etc.)
2. **Build check**: Run the build command and confirm no errors
3. **Lint check**: Run the lint tool if configured

**If ANY check fails**, display and STOP:
```
❌ Execution Verification failed for [FID] - [Feature Name]:
  Tests: [PASS/FAIL — pass count/total, failure details]
  Build: [PASS/FAIL — error summary]
  Lint:  [PASS/FAIL — critical issue count]

Fix the failing checks before verification can continue.
Verification is BLOCKED — merge will not be allowed until all checks pass.
```

**Use AskUserQuestion** with options:
- "Fix and re-verify" — user will fix, then re-run `/smart-sdd verify`
- "Show failure details" — display full test/build/lint output
- "Acknowledge limited verification" — proceed with ⚠️ limited-verify (requires reason)

**If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1). **Do NOT proceed to Phase 2** until all three checks pass **OR** the user explicitly acknowledges limited verification.

**Limited-verify exception path**: If the user selects "Acknowledge limited verification":
1. Ask for the reason (e.g., "Tests require external service not available", "Build depends on Feature B not yet merged", "DB migration requires completed Feature C")
2. Record in `sdd-state.md` Feature Detail Log → verify row Notes: `⚠️ LIMITED — [reason]`
3. Set the verify step icon to `⚠️` (not ✅) in Feature Progress
4. Proceed to Phase 2 — but the merge step will display a reminder that this Feature has limited verification
5. **This is NOT a skip** — the limitation is tracked and visible in status reports

> **Build prerequisites**: If the build fails due to missing setup steps (e.g., `pnpm approve-builds`, native module compilation), include the specific prerequisite command in the error message so the user knows what to run.

### Phase 2: Cross-Feature Consistency + Behavior Completeness Verification

**Step 1 — Cross-Feature consistency**:
- Check the cross-verification points in the "For /speckit.analyze" section of `pre-context.md`
- Analyze whether shared entities/APIs changed by this Feature affect other Features
- Verify that entity-registry.md and api-registry.md match the actual implementation

**Step 2 — Source Behavior Completeness** (only for brownfield rebuild — Origin: `rebuild`):
If `pre-context.md` contains a "Source Behavior Inventory" section, perform a per-Feature mini-parity check:

1. Read the Source Behavior Inventory table (function/method list with P1/P2/P3 priorities)
2. Read the Feature's `spec.md` FR-### list
3. For each P1/P2 behavior, check if a corresponding FR-### exists that covers the behavior
4. Display a coverage summary:
   ```
   📊 Source Behavior Coverage for [FID]:
     P1 behaviors: [covered]/[total] ([%])
     P2 behaviors: [covered]/[total] ([%])
     P3 behaviors: [covered]/[total] (informational)
     Uncovered P1: [list function names]
     Uncovered P2: [list function names]
   ```
5. **If any P1 behavior is uncovered**: Display a warning — `⚠️ [N] P1 source behaviors not covered by FR-###. These may represent missing functionality.`
   - This is a **warning, not a blocker** — the user may proceed but should consider whether the omission is intentional
6. If no Source Behavior Inventory exists (greenfield/add), skip this step

### Phase 3: Demo-Ready Verification (BLOCKING — only if VI. Demo-Ready Delivery is in the constitution)

> **If VI. Demo-Ready Delivery is NOT in the constitution**: Skip this phase entirely.
> Demo standards referenced in this phase are defined in [reference/demo-standard.md](../reference/demo-standard.md).

**Step 1 — Check demo script exists AND is a real demo (NOT markdown, NOT test-only)**:
- Verify `demos/F00N-name.sh` (or `.ts`/`.py`/etc. matching the project's language) exists
- **REJECT if**: the file is `.md`, contains `## Demo Steps`, or consists of prose instructions instead of executable commands
- **REJECT if**: the file lacks a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env bash` or equivalent) for `.sh` files
- **REJECT if**: the script only runs test assertions and exits (that's a test suite, not a demo) — a demo must launch the real Feature for the user to experience

- If a markdown demo file or test-only script was generated instead, **delete it** and create a proper demo script

**Step 2 — Check the demo launches the real Feature**:
- The demo script's default behavior must **start the Feature** and keep it running for the user to interact with
- The script must print concrete "Try it" instructions: real URLs to open, real curl commands to run, real CLI invocations to try (at least 2)
- The `--ci` flag must be supported for automated verification: runs setup + health check, then exits cleanly
- **REJECT if**: the script has no interactive experience (i.e., only runs assertions and exits with no live Feature)

**Step 2b — UI Verification Hook** (optional — only if Playwright MCP available):
- After health check passes and before `--ci` exits, if Playwright MCP tools are available in the session:
  1. Parse demo script stdout for URLs (pattern: `http://localhost:\d+/...`)
  2. Navigate to each URL via Playwright
  3. Verify page loads (no error state, page title present)
  4. If demo script has a `# Playwright` header comment: run listed assertions (element existence, clickability)
  5. Take screenshot for review evidence
  6. Report: `UI verification: ✅ [N] pages verified, [N] elements checked`
- **If Playwright MCP not available**: skip silently (no warning, no degradation)
- **If UI verification fails**: report as warning (⚠️), not blocker — health check already passed
- See [reference/ui-testing-integration.md](../reference/ui-testing-integration.md) for full guide

**Step 3 — Check coverage mapping and demo components**:
- The demo script must include a **Coverage** header comment mapping FR-###/SC-### from spec.md to what the user can try/see in the demo
  - Each FR/SC should be either ✅ (demonstrated) or ⬜ (not demoed with reason)
  - **Aim for maximum coverage** — every functional requirement should be experienceable in the demo unless genuinely impossible
  - If coverage is below 50% of the Feature's FR count, **WARN** the user and suggest expanding the demo
- The demo script must include a **Demo Components** header comment listing each component as Demo-only or Promotable
- Demo-only components are marked with `// @demo-only` (removed after all Features complete)
- Promotable components are marked with `// @demo-scaffold — will be extended by F00N-[feature]`

**Step 4 — Execute the demo in CI mode (`--ci`)**:
- Run `demos/F00N-name.sh --ci` and verify it completes without errors (health check passes)
- Capture the demo output (stdout/stderr) for the Review display
- **Runtime error scan (BLOCKING)**: After demo execution, scan the captured stdout/stderr for runtime error patterns:
  - `"level":"error"` or `"level":"fatal"` (structured log errors)
  - `Error occurred`, `Unhandled rejection`, `Uncaught exception`
  - `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, `SyntaxError` (JS runtime errors)
  - `No handler registered`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ENOENT` (service initialization failures)
  - `panic:`, `FATAL`, `segfault` (system-level crashes)
  - Process exit with non-zero code
- **If runtime errors are detected**: The demo is considered **FAILED** even if the health check (HTTP 200) passed — a healthy port does not mean the application is functioning correctly (e.g., Vite dev server may respond while Electron main process has fatal errors)
- Display each detected error with its source line for user review

**If any check fails**, display and BLOCK:
```
❌ Demo-Ready verification failed for [FID] - [Feature Name]:
  - [Missing: demos/F00N-name.sh | --ci health check failed: <error> | Demo is test-only (no live Feature) | Missing: Demo Components header | Missing: component markers]

"Tests pass" alone does not satisfy Demo-Ready Delivery.
A demo must launch the real, working Feature so the user can experience it.
Please create a demo script at demos/F00N-name.sh that:
  - Starts the Feature and prints "Try it" instructions (default)
  - Supports --ci for automated health check (verify phase)
  - Includes Demo Components with appropriate category markers
```

**Use AskUserQuestion** with options:
- "Fix and re-verify" — user will fix, then re-run `/smart-sdd verify`
- "Show failure details" — display full demo script output
- "Acknowledge limited verification" — proceed with ⚠️ limited-verify (requires reason)

**If response is empty → re-ask** (per MANDATORY RULE 1). **Do NOT proceed to Phase 4** until the demo passes **OR** the user explicitly acknowledges limited verification.

**Limited-verify exception path** (same as Phase 1): If the user selects "Acknowledge limited verification":
1. Ask for the reason (e.g., "Demo requires Feature B's UI not yet built", "No frontend in this Feature — pure library")
2. Append to `sdd-state.md` Feature Detail Log → verify Notes: `⚠️ DEMO-LIMITED — [reason]`
3. If Phase 1 already passed normally, set verify icon to `⚠️` (limited) instead of ✅
4. Proceed to Phase 4

- Update `demos/README.md` (Demo Hub) with the Feature's demo and what the user can experience:
  - `./demos/F00N-name.sh` — launches [brief description of the live demo experience]

### Phase 4: Global Evolution Update
- entity-registry.md: Verify that the actually implemented entity schemas match the registry; update if discrepancies are found
- api-registry.md: Verify that the actually implemented API contracts match the registry; update if discrepancies are found
- sdd-state.md: Record verification results — **status MUST be one of `success`, `limited`, or `failure`**, plus test pass/fail counts, build result, and verification timestamp. The merge step checks this status as a gate condition.
  - `success`: All phases passed normally
  - `limited`: User acknowledged limited verification in Phase 1 or Phase 3 (⚠️ marker). Merge is allowed with a reminder
  - `failure`: One or more phases failed without acknowledgment. Merge is blocked
